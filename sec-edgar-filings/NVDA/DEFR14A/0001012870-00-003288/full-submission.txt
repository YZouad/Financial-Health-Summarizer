                INFORMATION CONCERNING SOLICITATION AND VOTING

General

   The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors of
NVIDIA Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), for use at the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on July 12, 2000 at 2:00 p.m. local
time (the "Annual Meeting"), or at any adjournment or postponement thereof,
for the purposes set forth herein and in the accompanying Notice of Annual
Meeting. The Annual Meeting will be held at The Santa Clara Westin Hotel, 5101
Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, California. The Company intends to mail
this proxy statement and accompanying proxy card on or about June 16, 2000, to
all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.

Solicitation

   The Company will bear the entire cost of solicitation of proxies, including
preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of this proxy statement, the proxy
and any additional information furnished to stockholders. Copies of
solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses,
fiduciaries and custodians holding in their names shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners. The Company
may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of Common Stock for their
costs of forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Original
solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram or
personal solicitation by directors, officers or other regular employees of the
Company. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or
other regular employees for such services.

Voting Rights and Outstanding Shares

   Only holders of record of Common Stock at the close of business on June 5,
2000 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. At the
close of business on June 5, 2000, the Company had outstanding and entitled to
vote 32,221,953 shares of Common Stock.

   Each holder of record of Common Stock on such date will be entitled to one
vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon at the Annual
Meeting.

   All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the
meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes,
abstentions and broker non-votes. Abstentions will be counted towards the
tabulation of votes cast on proposals presented to the stockholders and will
have the same effect as negative votes. Broker non-votes are counted towards a
quorum, but are not counted for any purpose in determining whether a matter
has been approved.

Revocability of Proxies

   Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to
revoke it at any time before it is voted. It may be revoked by filing with the
Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive office, 3535
Monroe Street, Santa Clara, CA 95051, a written notice of revocation or a duly
executed proxy bearing a later date, or it may be revoked by attending the
meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the meeting will not, by itself,
revoke a proxy.

Stockholder Proposals

   The deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal for inclusion in the
Company's proxy statement and form of proxy for the Company's 2001 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), is February 12, 2001. If a stockholder
proposal or nomination for director is not submitted in time for inclusion in
the written proxy materials, such matter may be submitted for stockholder
approval at the annual meeting if it is submitted to the Company no earlier
than the close of business on March 14, 2001 and no later than the close of
business on April 13, 2001. Stockholders are also advised to review the
Company's Bylaws, which contain additional requirements with respect to
advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.

Pending Stock Split

   The Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in May 2000. The
stock split will be paid in the form of a stock dividend to be distributed on
June 26, 2000 to all stockholders of record on June 12, 2000. All share
numbers in this Proxy Statement are shown on an actual basis as of the date
indicated and do not reflect the stock split.

                                  Proposal 1

                             Election Of Directors

   The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that
the Board of Directors (the "Board") shall be divided into three classes, each
class consisting, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of
directors, with each class having a three-year term. Vacancies on the Board
may be filled only by persons elected by a majority of the remaining
directors. A director elected by the Board to fill a vacancy (including a
vacancy created by an increase in the Board) shall serve for the remainder of
the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and
until such director's successor is elected and qualified.

   The Board is presently composed of seven members. There are two directors
in the class whose term of office expires in 2000. Each of the nominees for
election to this class is currently a director of the Company. If elected at
the Annual Meeting, each of the nominees would serve until the 2003 annual
meeting and until his successor is elected and has qualified, or until such
director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

   Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting. Shares represented
by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for
the election of the two nominees named below. In the event that any nominee
should be unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence,
such shares will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as
management may propose. Each person nominated for election has agreed to serve
if elected, and management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be
unable to serve.

   Set forth below is biographical information for each person nominated and
each person whose term of office as a director will continue after the Annual
Meeting.

Board Committees and Meetings

   During the fiscal year ended January 30, 2000, the Board held seven (7)
meetings. The Board has an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee.

   The Audit Committee meets with the Company's independent accountants at
least annually to review the results of the annual audit and discuss the
financial statements, recommends to the Board the independent accountants to
be retained and receives and considers the accountants' comments as to
controls, adequacy of staff and management performance and procedures in
connection with audit and financial controls. The Audit Committee consists of
two non-employee directors: Messrs. Seawell and Stevens. The Audit Committee
was formed upon the effectiveness of the Company's initial public offering on
January 21, 1999. It met four (4) times during the fiscal year ended January
30, 2000.

   The Compensation Committee makes recommendations concerning salaries and
incentive compensation, awards stock options to employees and consultants
under the Company's stock option plans and otherwise determines compensation
levels and performs such other functions regarding compensation as the Board
may delegate. The Compensation Committee has delegated to Jen-Hsun Huang the

for employees below the vice president level. The Compensation Committee
consists of two non-employee directors: Messrs. Coxe and Jones. It met four
(4) times during the fiscal year ended January 30, 2000.

which he served that were held during the period for which he was a director
or committee member, respectively.

                                  Proposal 2

               Ratification Of Selection Of Independent Auditors

   The Board has selected KPMG LLP as the Company's independent auditors for
the fiscal year ending January 28, 2001 and has further directed that
management submit the selection of independent auditors for ratification by
the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. KPMG LLP has audited the Company's
financial statements since April 1995. Representatives of KPMG LLP are
expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make
a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate
questions.

                                       4
<PAGE>

   Stockholder ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as the Company's
independent auditors is not required by the Company's Bylaws or otherwise.
However, the Board is submitting the selection of KPMG LLP to the stockholders
for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders
fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee and the Board will
reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is
ratified, the Audit Committee and the Board in their discretion may direct the
appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if
they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders.

   The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in
person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will
be required to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP. Abstentions will be counted
toward the tabulation of votes cast on proposals presented to the stockholders
and will have the same effect as negative votes. Broker non-votes are counted
towards a quorum, but are not counted for any purpose in determining whether
this matter has been approved.

                       The Board of Directors Recommends
                         A Vote In Favor Of Proposal 2

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

   Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and
executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered
class of the Company's equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports
of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of Common Stock and other
equity securities of the Company. Officers, directors and greater than ten
percent stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company
with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

   To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such
reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other
reports were required, during the fiscal year ended January 30, 2000, all
Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and
greater than ten percent beneficial owners were complied with.

                            Executive Compensation

Compensation of Directors

   Directors do not receive any cash compensation for their services as
members of the Board of Directors, although they are reimbursed for certain
expenses incurred in connection with attendance at Board and committee
meetings. From time to time, certain non-employee directors of the Company
have received grants of options to purchase shares of the Company's Common
Stock. In July 1996, each of Messrs. Coxe and Stevens was granted an option to
purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price of
$.36 per share. In December 1998, Mr. Gaither was granted an option to
purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price of
$7.00 per share. In November 1993 and August 1996, Mr. Jones was granted
options to purchase 75,000 and 70,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at
exercise prices of $.05 and $.36 per share, respectively. In November 1994 and
September 1996, Mr. Miller was granted options to purchase 75,000 and 50,000
shares of the Company's Common Stock at exercise prices of $.05 and $.36 per
share, respectively. In December 1997 and December 1998, Mr. Seawell was
granted options to purchase 50,000 and 32,050 shares of the Company's Common
Stock at exercise prices of $3.15 and $7.00 per share, respectively.

   Each non-employee director of the Company also receives nonstatutory stock
option grants under the Company's 1998 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option
Plan (the "Directors' Plan"). Only non-employee directors of the Company or an
affiliate of such directors are eligible to receive options under the
Director's Plan.

   Option grants under the Director's Plan are non-discretionary. Each person
who is elected or appointed for the first time to be a non-employee director
automatically will, upon the date of his or her initial election or
appointment to be a non-employee director by the Board or stockholders of the
Company, be granted an option to purchase 50,000 shares of Common Stock (an
"Initial Grant"). On the day following each Annual Meeting of Stockholders of
the Company ("Annual Meeting"), each member of the Company's Board who is not
an employee of the Company is automatically granted one or more options to
purchase shares of Common Stock without further action by the Company, the
Board or the stockholders of the Company as follows: (i) Each non-employee
director will be granted an option to purchase 20,000 shares of Common Stock
of the Company (an "Annual Grant"); provided, however, that if the person has
not been serving as a non-employee director for the entire period since the
prior Annual Meeting, then the number of shares granted will be reduced pro
rata for each full quarter prior to the date of grant during which such person
did not serve as a non-employee director; and (ii) each non-employee director
who is a member of a committee of the Board will be granted an option to
purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company for each such committee
(a "Committee Grant"); provided, however, that if the person has not been
serving on such committee since the prior Annual Meeting, then the number of
shares granted will be reduced pro rata for each full quarter prior to the
date of grant during which such person did not serve as a non-employee
director.

   Initial Grants will vest monthly over the four-year period following the
date of grant such that the entire Initial Grant will become exercisable on
the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. With respect to Annual Grants and
Committee Grants, if the optionee has attended at least 75% of the regularly
scheduled meetings of the Board or the committee, as applicable, held between
the date of grant of the option and the one-year anniversary of the date of
grant of the option, then such option will vest and become exercisable in full
on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. If the optionee's service as
a director or committee member, as the case may be, terminates between the
date of grant of the option and the one-year anniversary of the date of grant
of the option due to the disability or death of the optionee, then the option
will immediately vest and become exercisable on a monthly pro rata basis. If
the director fails to attend at least 75% of the regularly scheduled meetings
of the Board or the committee, as applicable, then such director's option will
vest annually over the four-year period following the date of grant at the
rate of 10% per year for the first three years and 70% for the fourth year,
such that the entire option will become exercisable on the four-year
anniversary of the date of grant of the option.

                                       8
<PAGE>

   The exercise price of the options granted under the Directors' Plan is
equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. No
option granted under the Directors' Plan may be exercised after the expiration
of 10 years from the date it was granted. Options granted under the Directors'
Plan generally are non-transferable except to family members, a family trust,
a family partnership or a family limited liability company. However, an
optionee may designate a beneficiary who may exercise the option following the
optionee's death. An optionee whose service relationship with the Company or
any affiliate (whether as a non-employee director of the Company or
subsequently as an employee, director or consultant of either the Company or
an affiliate) ceases for any reason, may exercise vested options for the term
provided in the option agreement (12 months generally, 18 months in the event
of death).

   If there is any sale of substantially all of the Company's assets, any
merger or any consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving
corporation or other change in control of the Company, all outstanding awards
under the Directors' Plan either will be assumed or substituted for by any
surviving entity. If the surviving entity determines not to assume or
substitute for such awards, the awards will terminate if not exercised prior
to such sale of assets, merger or consolidation.

   On March 30, 1998, each of Messrs. Coxe, Jones, Miller and Stevens was
automatically granted an option to purchase 20,000 shares of the Company's
Common Stock; Mr. Seawell was automatically granted an option to purchase
5,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock; each of Messrs. Coxe and Jones was
automatically granted an option to purchase 2,500 shares of the Company's
Common Stock; and each of Messrs. Miller, Seawell and Stevens was
automatically granted an option to purchase 1,250 shares of the Company's
Common Stock. In addition, in June 1999, non-employee directors received
automatic non-qualified stock option grants under the Director Plan, using the
criteria set forth in such Plan. Options to purchase shares of Common Stock in
the form of annual grants for service as directors were made to the following
directors: Mr. Coxe, 20,000 shares; Mr. Gaither, 5,000 shares; Mr. Jones,
20,000 shares; Mr. Miller, 20,000 shares; Mr. Seawell, 20,000 shares; and Mr.
Stevens, 20,000 shares. Options to purchase shares of Common Stock in the form
of annual grants for service as committee members of the Board of Directors
were made to the following directors: Mr. Coxe, 5,000 shares; Mr. Jones, 5,000
shares; Mr. Seawell, 5,000 shares; and Mr. Stevens, 5,000 shares. The
directors do not receive other any other form of compensation for their
service on the Board of Directors. Each of these options was granted under the
Director's Plan at fair market value on the date of grant.

   As of April 30, 2000, options to purchase 268,750 shares of Common Stock
were outstanding and 31,250 shares remained available for future grant under
the Directors' Plan. Unless terminated sooner, the Directors' Plan will
terminate in February 2008.

   The Company has entered into indemnity agreements with each of the
Company's directors and executive officers. The form of indemnity agreement
provides, among other things, that the Company will indemnify such executive
officer and director, under the circumstances and to the extent provided for
therein, for any and all expenses he or she may be required to pay in actions
or proceedings because of his or her status as a director or executive officer
of the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by the Company's Bylaws and
Delaware law.

(1) Initial option grants generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first
    anniversary of the vesting commencement date and 6.25% each quarter
    thereafter and have a term of 10 years. Subsequent option grants generally
    vest 6.25% per quarter from the date of grant.
(2) Based on an aggregate of 3,269,600 shares subject to options granted to
    persons who were employees or consultants of the Company in the fiscal
    year ended January 30, 2000, including the Named Executive Officers.
(3) The exercise price per share of each option was equal to the fair market
    value of the Common Stock on the date of grant as determined by the Board.
(4) The potential realizable value is calculated based on the term of the
    option at the time of grant (10 years). It is calculated assuming that the
    fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant
    appreciates at the indicated annual rate compounded annually for the
    entire term of the option and that the option is exercised at the exercise
    price and sold on the last day of its term at the appreciated price. Stock
    price appreciation of 5% and 10% is assumed pursuant to rules promulgated
    by the Securities and Exchange Commission and does not represent the
    Company's prediction of its stock price performance.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

   For the fiscal year ended January 30, 2000, the Compensation Committee
consisted of Messrs. Coxe and Jones. No current member of the Compensation
Committee is an officer or employee of the Company and no executive officer of
the Company serves as a member of a compensation committee of any entity that
has one or more executive officers serving as a member of the Compensation
Committee. Each of the Company's directors, or their affiliated entities,
other than Mr. Seawell, have purchased and hold securities of the Company.

        Report of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
                         on Executive Compensation/1/

Introduction

   The Company's executive compensation policies and practices are established
and administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
"Committee"). The Committee consists of two non-employee directors: Tench Coxe
and Harvey C. Jones, Jr. The Committee's determinations regarding compensation
of the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers are reviewed with
all the non-employee directors.

Philosophy

   The goals of the compensation program are: (1) to align the financial
interests of the executive officers and other key employees with those of the
stockholders; and (2) to provide a means for the Company to attract, retain,
and reward high-quality executives who contribute to the long-term success of
the Company.

  .  The Company's philosophy regarding base salaries for executives is
     conservative, with the goal of maintaining base salaries at the industry
     median for comparable companies.

  .  The Company maintains semi-annual incentive bonus opportunities that are
     intended to motivate executives to achieve specific operating and
     strategic objectives. The combination of base and incentive bonus is
     targeted to bring total compensation to competitive levels.

  .  The Company provides significant equity-based incentives for executives
     and other key employees to ensure they are motivated over the long-term
     to increase stockholder value and to contribute to the long-term growth
     of the Company.

Compensation Plans

   The Company's executive compensation is comprised of three elements, each
of which is intended to support the overall compensation philosophy.

   Base Salary. The Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining
compensation levels competitive with semiconductor and other leading
technology companies with which the Company competes for personnel. Base
salary is targeted at the median level for emerging companies in similar
businesses of similar characteristics such as sales volume, capitalization and
financial performance. The Committee reviews with the Chief Executive Officer
an annual salary plan for the Company's executive officers (other than the
Chief Executive Officer). The salary plan is modified as deemed appropriate
and approved by the Committee. The annual salary plan is developed based on an
annual review of executive salaries at semiconductor and other comparable
technology companies, including the Radford Survey. The industry group shown
on the Company's Performance Measurement Comparison Graph includes larger
companies included in such compensation survey, as well as companies of
comparable size within the fabless semiconductor sector. Such annual plan also
takes into account past performance and expected future contributions of the
individual executive.

   Bonus. The company introduced a semi-annual incentive bonus plan in the
second half of fiscal 2000 which provides bonus compensation to executives,
based on achievement of specific financial performance targets. The plan is
funded based on achieving a minimum threshold in operating margin and is
distributed based on individual performance objectives.

   Long-Term Incentives. Long-term incentives have been in the form of stock
options. The Committee believes that equity-based compensation closely aligns
the interests of executive officers with those of stockholders by providing an
incentive to manage the Company with a focus on long-term strategic objectives
set by the Board of Directors relating to growth and stockholder value. Stock
options are granted under the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan. Stock options are
granted at not less than fair market value and have value only if the
Company's stock price increases. The size of the option grant is determined
based on competitive practices in the technology industry and the Company's
philosophy of significantly linking executive compensation with stockholder
interests. Stock options vest in a series of installments over a four-year
period, contingent upon the executives continued employment with the Company.
Options terminate 10 years after the date of grant. Subsequent grants are
based on a number of factors, including individual performance, job level,
expected future performance, and the competitive environment.

   Executive officers are also generally eligible to participate in the
Company's 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Participation levels in such Plan
are at the discretion of each executive. However, as a result of applicable
laws regarding stock ownership, Messrs. Huang, Malachowsky and Priem are not
eligible to participate in this Plan.

   In fiscal 2000, the Committee determined that one officer, Jeffrey Fisher,
should receive option grants during fiscal 2000. The table on page 11 reflects
such grants. Out of a total of 3,269,600 options granted under the 1998 Equity
Incentive Plan in fiscal 2000, executive officers of the Company received
grants for 21,000 shares, or approximately 0.64% of the total options granted
under the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan in fiscal 2000.

   The Committee believes the programs described above provide compensation
that is competitive with comparable emerging technology companies, link
executive and stockholder interests and provide the basis for the Company to
attract and retain qualified executives. The Committee will continue to
monitor the relationship among executive compensation, the Company's
performance and stockholder value.

Chief Executive Officer Compensation

   Compensation for Jen-Hsun Huang, the Chief Executive Officer, is determined
by a process similar to that discussed above for executive officers. Mr.
Huang's base salary for fiscal 2000 was $300,000. Following the Committee's
review of compensation paid to Chief Executive Officers at other comparable
technology companies, the Committee increased Mr. Huang's annual base salary
in fiscal 2001 to $400,000. In addition, Mr. Huang's annual bonus target was
increased from $300,000 in fiscal 2000 to $400,000 in fiscal 2001, and is
based on achieving key financial and other strategic objectives.

   In fiscal 2001, Mr. Huang was also granted an option to acquire 400,000
shares of common stock at the fair market value of the stock on such date.
This option vests on a quarterly basis over four years following the date of
the grant. This grant was intended to continue to maintain the overall
competitiveness of Mr. Huang's compensation package and strengthen the
alignment of Mr. Huang's interests with those of the stockholders during a
critical phase of the Company's development. The Committee intends to continue
to monitor Mr. Huang's compensation level in light of his performance and the
compensation levels of executives at comparable companies.
