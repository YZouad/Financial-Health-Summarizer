January 21, 1999

NVIDIA Corporation
3535 Monroe Street
Santa Clara, CA 95051

Ladies and Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion with respect to certain matters in connection
with the filing by NVIDIA Corporation (the "Company") of a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 (the "462(b) Registration Statement"), with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), to be filed with the Commission on
January 22, 1999 pursuant to Rule 462(b) promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the related Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No.
333-47495) (collectively with the 462(b) Registration Statement the
"Registration Statements") in connection with the underwritten public offering
of up to 4,025,000 shares of common stock, including 525,000 shares of common
stock for which the Underwriters have been granted an over-allotment option (the
"Common Stock").

In connection with this opinion, we have (i) examined and relied upon the
Registration Statements and related Prospectus, the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws and the originals or copies certified to our
satisfaction of such records, documents, certificates, memoranda and other
instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us to
render the opinion expressed below, and (ii) assumed that the shares of the
Common Stock will be sold by the Underwriters at a price established by the
Pricing Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

On the basis of the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, we are of the opinion
that the Common Stock, when sold and issued in accordance with the Registration 
Statements, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

We consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in
the Prospectus included in the Registration Statements and to the filing of
this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statements.

Very truly yours,

Cooley Godward LLP
