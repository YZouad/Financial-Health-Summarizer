                                  [3DFX LOGO]

Dear 3dfx Shareholder:

   You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of shareholders of
3dfx Interactive, Inc. to be held on        ,       , 2001, at 8:00 a.m. local
time, at       , California. At the special meeting, we are seeking your
approval of the winding up and dissolution of 3dfx as described in the plan of
dissolution attached to the prospectus/proxy statement as Annex A, as well as
your approval of the sale of certain of our assets to NVIDIA US Investment
Company, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NVIDIA Corporation, as
described in the asset purchase agreement attached as Annex B to the
prospectus/proxy statement. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement,
3dfx will sell certain of its assets to NVIDIA US Investment Company and will
receive a total consideration of $70 million in cash and 1,000,000 shares of
NVIDIA common stock, subject to adjustment.

   3dfx began encountering financial difficulties in the fall of 2000 due to a
number of factors, including substantially reduced demand in the retail
channels for its products. At that time, we re-evaluated our business model and
decided that it was necessary to quickly reposition 3dfx to focus principally
on the development of graphics chips and related technologies, and to further
analyze the possible termination or sale of our graphics board business. In
seeking to implement this strategy, we entered into discussions with numerous
parties to whom we sought to sell our graphics board business or from whom we
sought to obtain financing necessary to the continuation of our business. None
of these discussions resulted in the execution of any definitive agreements,
and in the meantime our financial condition continued to deteriorate.

   In November 2000 we directed our financial advisor, Robertson Stephens, to
conduct a search to identify possible parties for either a strategic or
financial transaction. Both our management and Robertson Stephens contacted a
number of parties and discussed a variety of possible transactions. Your board
of directors considered a wide range of alternatives to address the challenges
that we faced, and determined that the alternatives were inferior to the
proposed NVIDIA transaction. We strongly believe that there is no better
alternative currently available to us, either as an independent company or in a
business combination transaction.

   Your board of directors also considered 3dfx's anticipated prospects
assuming completion of the asset sale, in which case 3dfx's remaining operating
assets would largely consist of proceeds from the asset sale and assets
relating to 3dfx's graphics board business. After consideration of all other
alternatives available to 3dfx, the board of directors concluded, in its
business judgment, that the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx,
and the completion of the asset sale as part of that process, was the
alternative most reasonably likely to enable 3dfx to pay its creditors and to
maximize the return of value to its shareholders.

   Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please take the time
to vote by completing the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the
accompanying postage-paid envelope or by voting by phone or over the Internet
as described in the instructions accompanying the enclosed proxy card. Both the
dissolution of 3dfx and the asset sale require the approval of a majority in
interest of 3dfx's shareholders. Please note that your failure to vote on these
matters will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the dissolution
of 3dfx and the asset sale. The other directors and I urge you to vote FOR each
of the proposals, which we have approved after careful consideration. Your vote
is extremely important, and your early response will be greatly appreciated.

                                      Sincerely,

     , 2001                           Alex Leupp
San Jose, California                  President and Chief Executive Officer

voting at the 3dfx special meeting, see "Risk Factors" beginning on page 21.

       QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ASSET SALE AND DISSOLUTION OF 3DFX

1.Q:   What is 3dfx entitled to receive for the assets proposed to be sold to
       NVIDIA US Investment Company? (see pages 66 and 76)

  A: NVIDIA, NVIDIA US Investment Company, formerly known as Titan
     Acquisition Corp. No. 2, and 3dfx have signed a purchase agreement
     pursuant to which NVIDIA US Investment Company will purchase certain of
     the assets of 3dfx, including its core graphics processor assets. In
     return for these assets, NVIDIA US Investment Company will pay to 3dfx a
     total consideration of $70 million in cash and 1,000,000 shares of
     NVIDIA's common stock. The number of shares of NVIDIA common stock to be
     received by 3dfx in the asset sale could be reduced if, after the
     closing of the asset sale and prior to the dissolution of 3dfx, 3dfx
     requests that NVIDIA US Investment Company advance to it funds of up to
     $25 million to be used by 3dfx to pay its or its subsidiaries'
     creditors. If, upon satisfaction of various conditions, the advance is
     provided by NVIDIA US Investment Company, the number of NVIDIA shares to
     be received by 3dfx will be reduced by a number of shares determined by
     dividing the amount of the advance by $50, without regard to the value
     of NVIDIA's common stock at the time of any such advance. The number of
     shares of NVIDIA common stock to be received by 3dfx is also subject to
     adjustments in the event of a stock split or similar event by NVIDIA.
     Neither 3dfx nor NVIDIA has the right to terminate the purchase
     agreement or renegotiate the number of shares to be received by 3dfx as
     a result of market price fluctuations in the value of NVIDIA common
     stock.

    You should know that, on the day they signed the purchase agreement,
    3dfx, NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company entered into other
    agreements that are related to, but separate from, the asset sale.
    Because 3dfx did not have sufficient cash to continue its operations
    through the closing of the asset sale, 3dfx and NVIDIA US Investment
    Company entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which NVIDIA US
    Investment Company provided a $15 million loan to 3dfx, which is
    repayable out of the cash consideration that is to be received by 3dfx
    upon closing of the asset sale. In exchange for the loan, 3dfx: (i)
    assigned and transferred all of its trademarks, tradenames, service
    marks, trademark applications and service mark applications to NVIDIA
    US Investment Company pursuant to a trademark assignment; and (ii)
    granted NVIDIA US Investment Company a non-exclusive, fully-paid,
    royalty-free license for most of 3dfx's patents, patent applications
    and inventions pursuant to a patent license agreement. The patent
    license also contains a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free license
    to 3dfx from NVIDIA for most of NVIDIA's patents, patent applications
    and inventions. In addition, also on the same day as the purchase
    agreement, 3dfx and NVIDIA entered into a patent standstill agreement
    pursuant to which they both agreed to stay the pending patent lawsuits
    that each has filed against the other, and, if the asset sale closes or
    under other designated circumstances, to cause the dismissal of these
    suits with prejudice, and to refrain from bringing additional
    litigation against each other with respect to other patents, patent
    applications and inventions for a three-year period, unless terminated
    earlier. Under California law, 3dfx is not required to submit these
    related transactions to its shareholders for their approval.

2.Q:   What happens if the asset sale is not completed? (see page 21)

  A: If the asset sale is not completed, it is likely that 3dfx will file for
     or be forced to resort to bankruptcy protection. In this event, it is
     extremely unlikely that 3dfx will be able to satisfy all of its and its
     subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, and there would therefore be no
     assets available for distribution to 3dfx's shareholders.

    Even if the asset sale is not completed, in specific circumstances,
    including if 3dfx's shareholders fail to approve the asset sale, the
    patent license and patent standstill agreements would remain in place.
    This means that NVIDIA US Investment Company would retain the non-
    exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free patent license to most of 3dfx's
    patents, patent applications and inventions and each of

                                       1
<PAGE>

    NVIDIA and 3dfx would still cause the pending patent litigation against
    the other to be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, 3dfx could be
    required to make one or more of the following payments to NVIDIA US
    Investment Company upon the occurrence of specific termination events
    under the purchase agreement: (i) repayment of $5 million of the $15
    million loaned to 3dfx under the credit agreement; (ii) payment of a
    termination fee of $3.3 million; and (iii) reimbursement of NVIDIA's
    and NVIDIA US Investment Company's transaction-related expenses.
    Further, regardless of whether the asset sale is completed or the
    reasons for the termination of the purchase agreement, NVIDIA US
    Investment Company will retain ownership of all of the 3dfx trademarks,
    tradenames, service marks, trademark applications and service mark
    applications that it received in connection with the credit agreement
    and trademark assignment.

3.Q:   When do you expect the asset sale to be completed? (see page 67)

  A: The parties are working toward completing the transaction as quickly as
     possible. In addition to 3dfx shareholder approval, the transaction must
     also receive clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
     Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or HSR Act, and each of NVIDIA and
     3dfx must satisfy or waive, to the extent possible, all of the closing
     conditions contained in the purchase agreement. The parties hope to
     complete the asset sale promptly after the 3dfx special meeting.

4.Q:   What does the plan of dissolution entail? (see page 58)

  A: The plan of dissolution provides for the liquidation, winding up and
     dissolution of 3dfx by selling those assets of 3dfx that are part of the
     asset sale and, after the closing of the asset sale, proceeding with the
     orderly liquidation of its remaining assets and winding up of its
     business and operations. 3dfx will then pay, or provide for the payment
     of, all of its and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities. If there are
     any remaining assets after the payment, or the provision for the
     payment, of all of its and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, 3dfx
     will distribute these remaining assets to its shareholders in one or
     more distributions.

5.Q:   Will any distributions be made to 3dfx's shareholders? (see page 60)

  A: At this time, 3dfx cannot determine if there will be any assets
     remaining after paying for, or providing for the payment of, all of its
     and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities. 3dfx expects that following
     the closing of the asset sale it will request that NVIDIA US Investment
     Company provide all or a portion of the $25 million cash advance
     provided for in the purchase agreement in order to enable 3dfx to pay
     the debts owed to its and its subsidiaries' creditors that could not be
     paid from the cash consideration received by 3dfx at the closing. If a
     cash advance is made to 3dfx, then the number of NVIDIA shares
     receivable by 3dfx will be reduced by a number of shares determined by
     dividing the amount of the advance by $50. 3dfx expects that, upon
     receiving the cash consideration at the closing of the asset sale and
     after obtaining all or of a portion of the cash advance from NVIDIA US
     Investment Company, it will have sufficient cash to pay all of its and
     its subsidiaries' known current and determinable liabilities. However,
     the amount of unknown or contingent liabilities cannot be quantified and
     could decrease or eliminate any remaining assets available for
     distribution. Further, if 3dfx or its subsidiaries are subject to any
     substantial contingent liabilities, this could require that it establish
     reserves that could delay any distribution to 3dfx shareholders.

    Because of the uncertainties as to the precise net realizable value of
    3dfx's assets and the settlement amount of 3dfx's and its subsidiaries'
    debts and liabilities, 3dfx cannot at this time determine the amount of
    distributions that may be made to its shareholders, if any. Only if
    there are assets remaining at the time of the dissolution will you
    receive a portion of those assets, which will be equal to your pro rata
    share, based on the number of 3dfx shares you own.

                                       2
<PAGE>

6.Q:   When will any distributions be made to 3dfx's shareholders? (see page
       60)

  A: At this time, 3dfx cannot set a timetable for any distributions, and it
     is not certain whether any distributions will be made to its
     shareholders. The timetable will depend on the timing of the completion
     of the asset sale, the sale of 3dfx's remaining assets, and 3dfx's
     ability to pay, or provide for the payment of, its and its subsidiaries'
     debts and liabilities. If 3dfx is subject to any contingent liabilities,
     including any claims of NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company under the
     purchase agreement, this could require that it establish a reserve that
     could delay any distribution to 3dfx shareholders until the liabilities
     are resolved.

7.Q:   When will the dissolution of 3dfx be completed? (see page 59)

  A: The dissolution will be completed on the date that 3dfx's certificate of
     dissolution is filed with, and is accepted by, the Secretary of State of
     the State of California or the date that 3dfx files with the Secretary
     of State of the State of California a court order declaring 3dfx
     dissolved. 3dfx plans to make such filing after it has paid for, or
     provided for the payment of, all of its and its subsidiaries' debts and
     liabilities, and distributed any remaining assets to its shareholders.

8.Q:   What happens if 3dfx shareholders approve the dissolution of 3dfx but
       not the asset sale? (see pages 21, 22 and 72)

  A: If 3dfx's shareholders approve the dissolution of 3dfx but not the asset
     sale, then the asset sale will not close and it is likely that 3dfx will
     file for or be forced to resort to bankruptcy protection. In this event,
     it is extremely unlikely that 3dfx will be able to satisfy all of its
     and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, and there would therefore
     be no assets available for distribution to 3dfx's shareholders. Under
     the purchase agreement, NVIDIA is not obligated to close the asset sale
     if 3dfx's shareholders do not approve the dissolution of 3dfx.

9.Q:   What do I need to do now? (see page 38)

  A: You should read this prospectus/proxy statement carefully in its
     entirety, including its Annexes, to consider how the matters discussed
     will affect you. You should mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed
     return envelope or otherwise vote in a manner described in this
     prospectus/proxy statement as soon as possible so that your shares will
     be represented at the 3dfx special meeting.

10.Q:  Can I submit my proxy by telephone or over the Internet? (see page 38)

  A: Only beneficial holders who hold shares in street name may submit their
     proxies by telephone or over the Internet. If you are a beneficial
     holder, you should refer to the proxy card included with your proxy
     materials for instructions about how to vote. If you vote by telephone
     or over the Internet, you do not need to complete and mail your proxy
     card.

11.Q:  What happens if I do not return a proxy card or vote by phone or over
       the Internet?

  A: The failure to return your proxy card or vote by phone or over the
     Internet will have the same effect as voting AGAINST approval of the
     asset sale and dissolution of 3dfx.

12.Q:  What happens if I return a signed proxy card but do not indicate how to
       vote my proxy? (see page 38)

  A: If you do not include instructions on how to vote your properly signed
     and dated proxy, your shares will be voted FOR approval of the asset
     sale and dissolution of 3dfx.

13.Q:  May I vote in person? (see page 39)

  A: Yes. You may attend the 3dfx special meeting and vote your shares in
     person, rather than signing and returning your proxy card or voting by
     phone or over the Internet.

                                       3
<PAGE>

14.Q:  May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or voted
       by phone or over the Internet? (see page 39)

  A: Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy card or
     phone or Internet vote is voted at the 3dfx special meeting. You can do
     this in one of three ways. First, you can send a written, dated notice
     stating that you would like to revoke your proxy or similarly do so by
     phone or over the Internet. Second, you can complete, date and submit a
     new proxy card. Third, you can attend the meeting and vote in person.
     Your attendance alone will not revoke your proxy. If you have instructed
     a broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions received from
     your broker to change those instructions.

15.Q:  If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote
       my shares for me?

  A: Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions
     from you. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares by
     following the procedure provided by your broker. The failure to provide
     such voting instructions to your broker will have the same effect as
     voting AGAINST approval of the asset sale and plan of dissolution.

16.Q:  Should I send in my 3dfx stock certificates?

  A: No. Please do not mail in your 3dfx stock certificates. If the asset
     sale and dissolution of 3dfx are approved, 3dfx will provide
     instructions regarding surrendering your stock certificates.

17.Q:  What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the asset
       sale and the liquidation to 3dfx shareholders? (see pages 55 and 62)

  A: The asset sale will have no direct U.S. federal income tax consequences
     to 3dfx shareholders. However, the asset sale will have tax consequences
     to 3dfx and the liquidation of 3dfx and possible distribution of assets
     to 3dfx shareholders will have tax consequences to 3dfx shareholders.
     The fair market value of any assets distributed to a 3dfx shareholder in
     the liquidation (including any assets transferred to a liquidating
     trust), less such shareholder's cost basis in its shares, will be
     taxable as capital gains (or loss), assuming that such shareholder held
     the shares as a capital asset. The gain (or loss) will be taxable as
     long-term capital gain (or loss) if the shares were held for more than
     one year. Tax consequences to shareholders may differ depending on their
     circumstances. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor to
     determine your particular tax consequences resulting from the asset sale
     and dissolution.

18.Q:  Can I still sell my shares of 3dfx common stock? (see pages 26 and 61 )

  A: Yes, 3dfx's common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq National
     Market. However, if the trading price of 3dfx's common stock remains
     less than $1.00 per share for an extended period, it is likely that the
     stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. If that happens,
     trading would thereafter be conducted on the over-the-counter market in
     the so-called "pink sheets" or on the "electronic bulletin board" of the
     National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. In this event, the
     ability to buy and sell shares of 3dfx common stock may be materially
     impaired, which may have an adverse effect on the price and liquidity of
     3dfx common stock.

19.Q:  How will the dissolution of 3dfx affect my status as a shareholder?

  A: Your rights as a 3dfx shareholder will terminate upon the dissolution of
     3dfx. 3dfx will not dissolve until its remaining assets, if any, are
     either distributed to its shareholders or transferred to a liquidating
     trust, and 3dfx files a certificate of dissolution that is accepted by
     the Secretary of State of the State of California or files with the
     Secretary of State of the State of California a court order declaring
     3dfx dissolved. 3dfx may establish a liquidating trust for the sole
     purpose of liquidating any remaining assets of 3dfx, paying or providing
     for the payment of 3dfx's and its subsidiaries'

                                       4
<PAGE>

     remaining debts and liabilities, and making distributions to 3dfx
     shareholders. If a liquidating trust is established, you will receive
     beneficial interests in the assets transferred to the liquidating trust
     in proportion to the number of 3dfx shares owned by you.

20.Q: Am I entitled to dissenters' rights? (see pages 55 and 65)

  A: No, 3dfx shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights, either in
     connection with the asset sale or the dissolution of 3dfx.

21.Q: Is NVIDIA stockholder approval required?

  A: No, such approval is not required in connection with the asset sale or
     the dissolution of 3dfx.

22.Q: Who can help answer my additional questions? (see page 97)

  A: 3dfx shareholders who would like additional copies, without charge, of
     this prospectus/proxy statement or have additional questions about the
     transaction, including the procedures for voting 3dfx shares, should

   3dfx develops high performance, cost-effective graphics chips, graphics
boards, software and related technology that enables an interactive and
realistic 3D experience across multiple hardware platforms. 3dfx develops
products with 2D and 3D functionality that optimize both entertainment and
general personal computer graphics applications and that are well suited to the
PC retail channel.

   Since 3dfx entered the purchase agreement on December 15, 2000 providing for
the sale of certain of its assets to NVIDIA US Investment Company, it has
substantially reduced its costs in order to conserve its resources. These cost-
cutting measures include a reduction of a significant portion of 3dfx's
workforce, reduction in office space and other efforts to reduce non-essential
expenses. 3dfx has also been providing manufacturing services to third parties
to help cover the overhead associated with its Juarez, Mexico manufacturing
facility pending the sale of that facility. Due to these cost-cutting measures,
3dfx's operations have been substantially curtailed.

   3dfx has maintained sites on the Internet at www.3dfx.com and
www.3dfxgamers.com. Information found on 3dfx's Web sites is not a part of this
document. 3dfx was incorporated in the State of California in August 1994.

Asset Sale and Related Transactions (Pages 66 and 76)

   NVIDIA US Investment Company, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NVIDIA,
will purchase certain of 3dfx's assets, including its core graphics processor
assets, pursuant to the purchase agreement. In consideration of the transfer of
these assets and the other matters set forth in the purchase agreement, NVIDIA
US Investment Company will pay to 3dfx a total consideration of $70 million in
cash at closing and, upon the dissolution of 3dfx, 1,000,000 shares of NVIDIA
common stock. The purchase and sale of certain of the assets of 3dfx pursuant
to the purchase agreement is referred to throughout this prospectus/proxy
statement as the "asset sale." 3dfx is required under California law to obtain
the approval of its shareholders to complete the asset sale.

   The number of shares of NVIDIA common stock to be received by 3dfx pursuant
to the purchase agreement could be reduced if, after the closing of the asset
sale and prior to the dissolution of 3dfx, 3dfx requests that NVIDIA US
Investment Company advance it funds of up to $25 million to be used by 3dfx to
pay its and its subsidiaries' creditors. If, upon satisfaction of various
conditions, the advance is provided by NVIDIA US Investment Company, the number
of NVIDIA shares receivable by 3dfx will be reduced by a number of shares
determined by dividing the amount of the advance by $50, without regard to the
value of NVIDIA's common stock at the time of any advance. The number of shares
of NVIDIA common stock to be received by 3dfx is also subject to adjustments in
the event of a stock split or similar event by NVIDIA. Neither 3dfx nor NVIDIA
has the right to terminate the purchase agreement or renegotiate the number of
shares issuable by NVIDIA as a result of market price fluctuations in the value
of NVIDIA common stock. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations
of NVIDIA common stock.

   On the day they signed the purchase agreement, 3dfx, NVIDIA and NVIDIA US
Investment Company entered into other agreements that are related to, but
separate from, the asset sale. Because 3dfx did not have sufficient cash to
continue its operations through the closing of the asset sale, 3dfx and NVIDIA
US Investment Company entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which NVIDIA
US Investment Company provided 3dfx a

                                       7
<PAGE>

$15 million loan, which is repayable out of the cash consideration that 3dfx
will receive upon the closing of the asset sale, and received in exchange:

  . the assignment and transfer of all of 3dfx's trademarks, tradenames,
    service marks, trademark applications and service mark applications
    pursuant to a trademark assignment; and

  . a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free license for most of 3dfx's
    patents, patent applications and inventions pursuant to a patent license
    agreement.

   The patent license also contains a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free
license to 3dfx from NVIDIA for most of NVIDIA's patents, patent applications
and inventions. In addition, on the day they signed the purchase agreement,
3dfx and NVIDIA entered a patent standstill agreement pursuant to which they
both agreed to stay the pending patent lawsuits that each has filed against the
other, and, if the asset sale closes and under other designated circumstances,
to cause the dismissal of these suits with prejudice, and to refrain from
bringing additional litigation against each other with respect to other
patents, patent applications and inventions for a three-year period. These
transactions entered into contemporaneously with the purchase agreement are
referred to throughout this prospectus/proxy statement as the "related
transactions." Under California law, 3dfx is not required to obtain shareholder
approval to complete these related transactions.

Dissolution of 3dfx (Page 56)

   The plan of dissolution provides for the liquidation, winding up and
dissolution of 3dfx. The plan of dissolution provides that, following approval
by 3dfx's shareholders, 3dfx will proceed with the closing of the asset sale
and the liquidation of its other assets, and will wind up its business and
operations and dissolve. To the extent that there are any remaining assets
after the payment of, or the provision for the payment of 3dfx's and its
subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, 3dfx will distribute such assets to its
shareholders in one or more distributions.

   The plan of dissolution grants broad discretion and authority to 3dfx's
board of directors in the administration of the plan of dissolution, including
the engagement of employees and consultants to facilitate the dissolution of
3dfx, the provision for indemnification of 3dfx's directors and officers,
payment of all of its and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities,
establishment of a liquidating trust and the determination of the timing and
amount of distributions. In addition, the plan of dissolution provides that
3dfx's board of directors may amend or delay implementation of the plan of
dissolution, unless the board of directors determines that such amendment or
delay would materially and adversely affect shareholders' interests.

   The actual amount of, timing of, and record dates for, any distributions to
3dfx's shareholders are not known at this time. These matters will be
determined after the commencement of liquidation proceedings in the sole
discretion of the 3dfx board of directors or the trustees of the liquidating
trust, as the case may be, and will depend upon a variety of factors, including
the timing of the closing of the asset sale, the net proceeds received in the
asset sale, the value of 3dfx's other assets, the ultimate amount of known and
unknown debts and liabilities of 3dfx and its subsidiaries and the amount of
liquidation-related expenses that must be satisfied out of 3dfx's assets.
Claims, liabilities and expenses will continue to accrue following approval of
the plan of dissolution, and 3dfx anticipates that expenses for professional
fees and other expenses of dissolution will be significant. These expenses will
reduce the amount of the assets available for distribution to 3dfx
shareholders.

   At this time, 3dfx cannot determine if there will be any assets remaining
after paying for, or providing for the payment of, all of its and its
subsidiaries' debts and liabilities. 3dfx expects that following the closing of
the asset sale it will request that NVIDIA US Investment Company provide all or
a portion of the $25 million cash advance provided for in the purchase
agreement in order to enable 3dfx to pay the debts owed to its and its
subsidiaries' creditors. If a cash advance is made to 3dfx, then the number of
NVIDIA shares receivable by

                                       8
<PAGE>

3dfx will be reduced by a number of shares determined by dividing the amount of
the advance by $50. 3dfx expects that, upon receiving the cash consideration at
the closing of the asset sale and after obtaining all or a portion of the cash
advance from NVIDIA US Investment Company, it will have sufficient cash to pay
all of its and its subsidiaries' known current and determinable liabilities.
However, the amount of unknown or contingent liabilities cannot be quantified
and could decrease or eliminate any remaining assets available for
distribution. Further, if 3dfx or its subsidiaries are subject to any
contingent liabilities, this could require that it establish reserves that
could delay any distribution to 3dfx shareholders.

   Because of the uncertainties as to the precise net realizable value of
3dfx's assets and the settlement amount of 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debts
and liabilities, 3dfx cannot at this time determine the amount of distributions
that may be made to its shareholders, if any. Only if there are assets
remaining at the time of the dissolution will you receive a portion of those
assets, which will be equal to your pro rata share, based on the number of 3dfx
shares you own.

   3dfx expects to receive a combination of cash and shares of NVIDIA common
stock in connection with the asset sale. 3dfx may distribute the shares of
NVIDIA common stock received by it at or about the time of its dissolution
directly to its shareholders, or it may sell these shares in the open market or
contribute the shares to a liquidating trust for the benefit of 3dfx's
shareholders. Further, 3dfx may elect to directly distribute shares of NVIDIA
common stock to some of its shareholders, while distributing an equivalent per
share value in cash to others who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional amount or small number of shares of NVIDIA common stock. At this
time, 3dfx is unable to provide specifics about the type or types of assets
that 3dfx's shareholders may receive or what the value of those assets might be
at the time of distribution, if a distribution is made to 3dfx's shareholders
by 3dfx or a liquidating trust at all.

   The liquidation of 3dfx's assets and the distribution of its remaining
assets, if any, to 3dfx shareholders will have tax consequences to 3dfx
shareholders. For more information about these consequences, see "The
Dissolution of 3dfx--Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Liquidation and Dissolution of 3dfx."

Reasons for the Purchase and Sale of 3dfx Assets

   NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company (Page 45). The boards of directors
of NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company approved the asset sale based on a
number of factors, including their belief that it may allow them to:

  . accelerate innovation and time-to-market and thereby better meet customer
    needs for next-generation graphics processors;

  . accelerate expansion into existing and new market segments for graphics
    processors;

  . be more competitive with other leading graphics processor companies,
    including, but not limited to, Intel Corporation, ATI Technologies Inc.,
    3Dlabs, Inc. Ltd., Matrox Electronic Systems, Ltd., Silicon Integrated
    Systems Corp., and VIA Technologies, Inc.;

  . add to their intellectual property portfolio in the field of graphics
    processors;

  . stay, and dismiss with prejudice upon closing of the asset sale or under
    other designated circumstances, the pending patent lawsuits between
    NVIDIA and 3dfx; and

  . have the opportunity to add qualified engineers and other technical
    employees from the former 3dfx workforce to NVIDIA US Investment Company
    and thereby enhance its expertise in graphics processor technology.

                                       9
<PAGE>


   3dfx (Page 47). The 3dfx board of directors approved the asset sale based on
a number of factors, including the following:

  . 3dfx's weakened financial position, which is attributable to a number of
    factors, including decreased demand in the retail PC market and in the
    add-in graphics segment;

  . the evaluation by 3dfx's board of directors of its business plan and the
    conclusion by the 3dfx board that 3dfx could not operate effectively in
    light of the significant losses it was incurring under its present
    business model, and that 3dfx would not be able to timely raise the
    capital necessary to successfully implement its revised business plan;

  . the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement, including the amount
    and form of consideration to be extended in the form of a $15 million
    loan immediately upon execution of the purchase agreement, the amount of
    cash and shares of NVIDIA common stock to be received on or after
    closing, and the financial ability of NVIDIA to provide funding for the
    asset sale so that the asset sale is not conditioned on financing, all of
    which led the 3dfx directors to conclude that it was reasonably likely
    that the asset sale would be completed and that as a result 3dfx would be
    able to satisfy the claims of its creditors and be in a position to
    maximize the return of value to its shareholders;

  . the efforts made by Robertson Stephens and 3dfx management to contact and
    determine the level of interest of third parties in a business
    combination or financial transaction; and

  . the financial presentation of Needham & Company, Inc. to the 3dfx board
    of directors, including Needham & Company, Inc.'s written opinion dated
    December 15, 2000, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and
    based upon and subject to the matters stated in the opinion, the
    consideration to be received by 3dfx in the asset sale was fair, from a
    financial point of view, to 3dfx.

Reasons for the Dissolution of 3dfx (Page 56)

   The 3dfx board of directors approved the liquidation, winding up and
dissolution of 3dfx based on a number of factors, including the following:

  . an assessment of the likely net proceeds from the asset sale remaining
    after the payment, or provision for payment, of all of the debts and
    liabilities owing to 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' creditors;

  . the questionable viability of a business based on 3dfx's remaining
    assets, which largely related to its graphics board business, and the
    possible applicability of 3dfx's remaining expertise in other areas;

  . the lack of success that 3dfx had already experienced in finding
    strategic buyers or sources of financing for the assets relating to its
    graphics board business;

  . the financial analysis conducted by Robertson Stephens, one of 3dfx's
    financial advisors, regarding the anticipated performance of a stand-
    alone graphics board business following closing of the asset sale;


  . the attractiveness of potentially being in a position to make a
    distribution to 3dfx's shareholders compared to the board of directors'
    assessment of 3dfx's expected future financial condition, earnings,
    business opportunities, strategies and competitive position; and

  . the comprehensive but unsuccessful efforts of 3dfx to locate alternative
    purchasers for its graphics board assets.

Opinion of 3dfx's Financial Advisor (Page 48)

   The board of directors of 3dfx received an opinion from Needham & Company,
Inc. as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to 3dfx of the
consideration to be received by 3dfx in connection with the asset

                                       10
<PAGE>

sale. The full text of Needham & Company, Inc.'s written opinion dated December
15, 2000 is attached to this prospectus/proxy statement as Annex C. You are
encouraged to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of
the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken. Needham & Company, Inc.'s opinion is addressed to the 3dfx board of
directors and relates only to the fairness of the consideration to 3dfx from a
financial point of view as of the date of the opinion. The opinion does not
address any other aspect of the asset sale and does not constitute a
recommendation to any 3dfx shareholder as to any matters relating to the asset
sale.

Recommendations to 3dfx Shareholders (Pages 47 and 58)

   The 3dfx board of directors has determined that the liquidation, winding up
and dissolution of 3dfx pursuant to the plan of dissolution and the sale of
certain of 3dfx's assets pursuant to the purchase agreement with NVIDIA and
NVIDIA US Investment Company are in the best interests of the creditors and
shareholders of 3dfx. The 3dfx board of directors has approved the dissolution
of 3dfx and the asset sale, and recommends that the shareholders of 3dfx vote
in favor of the dissolution of 3dfx and the asset sale.

The 3dfx Special Meeting of Shareholders (Page 38)

   Time, Date and Place. A 3dfx special meeting will be held on     ,      ,
2001, at        , at 8:00 a.m., local time.

   Record Date and Voting Power. You are entitled to vote at the 3dfx special
meeting if you owned shares of 3dfx common stock at the close of business on
     , 2001, the record date for the 3dfx special meeting. You will have one
vote at the 3dfx special meeting for each share of 3dfx common stock you owned
at the close of business on the record date. There are     outstanding shares
of 3dfx common stock entitled to be voted at the 3dfx special meeting.

   3dfx Required Vote. The approval of both the plan of dissolution of 3dfx and
the asset sale requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
3dfx common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date. The
proposal to approve the plan of dissolution will first be presented to 3dfx's
shareholders and, if approved, the proposal to approve the asset sale will then
be presented to 3dfx's shareholders.

   Share Ownership of Management. As of    , 2001, the directors and executive
officers of 3dfx and their affiliates owned approximately 2.2% of the shares
entitled to vote at the 3dfx special meeting. All of the directors and
executive officers of 3dfx that own 3dfx stock have agreed to vote their shares
in favor of approval of the asset sale and the dissolution of 3dfx.

Interests of Some 3dfx Officers in the Asset Sale (Page 53)

   Several officers of 3dfx have personal interests in the asset sale and the
dissolution of 3dfx that are different from, or in addition to, the interests
of most 3dfx shareholders. 3dfx is a party to employment agreements with some
of its senior executive officers, including Alex Leupp, Scott Sellers, Stephen
Lapinski, Richard Burns and Al Woodhull. These agreements, which were recently
amended, provide for a lump sum severance payment and COBRA premium
reimbursement benefits. Except with respect to Mr. Burns, who is entitled to
receive a lump sum severance benefit immediately upon termination of his
employment, the lump sum severance benefits to be paid to the other senior
executive officers are not payable until after 3dfx's payment of all of its
fixed and ascertainable debts and liabilities.

<PAGE>


Conditions to the Asset Sale (Page 69)

   The obligations of each of NVIDIA, NVIDIA US Investment Company and 3dfx to
complete the asset sale are subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions
in addition to the approval of a majority in interest of 3dfx's shareholders.

Termination of the Purchase Agreement (Page 72)

   Any of NVIDIA, NVIDIA US Investment Company or 3dfx is entitled to terminate
the purchase agreement under specified conditions, including, among others,
mutual written consent of the parties; if the asset sale has not been completed
by May 15, 2001; if a court issues a final and nonappealable order that
prohibits the asset sale; if the 3dfx shareholders do not approve the
dissolution of 3dfx or the asset sale; or if a triggering event occurs, such as
the failure of the board of directors of 3dfx to unanimously recommend approval
of the dissolution of 3dfx or the asset sale to 3dfx shareholders or the
approval or endorsement by the board of directors of 3dfx of an alternative
acquisition proposal.

Some Consequences of Termination (Page 73)

   Further, if the purchase agreement is terminated in some circumstances,
including as a result of the 3dfx shareholders failing to approve the
dissolution of 3dfx and the asset sale; or the occurrence of a triggering event
under the purchase agreement, 3dfx may be obligated to pay a fee of $3.3
million to NVIDIA US Investment Company and to reimburse NVIDIA and NVIDIA US
Investment Company for some of the fees incurred by them in connection with the
negotiation and preparation of the purchase agreement and related transaction
agreements. 3dfx also would be required to repay $5 million of the $15 million
loaned to it under the credit agreement.

   In some circumstances, even if the asset sale is not completed, including if
3dfx's shareholders fail to approve both the dissolution of 3dfx and the asset
sale, the patent license and patent standstill agreements would remain in
place. This means that NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company would retain a
non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free license to most of 3dfx's patents,
patent applications and inventions and each of NVIDIA and 3dfx would still
cause the pending patent litigation against the other to be dismissed with
prejudice. Further, regardless of whether the asset sale is completed, NVIDIA
US Investment Company will retain ownership of all of the 3dfx trademarks,
tradenames, service marks, trademark applications and service market
applications that it received in connection with the credit agreement and
trademark assignment.

Limitation on Considering other Acquisition Proposals (Page 70)

   3dfx has agreed not to consider a business combination or other similar
transaction with another party while the asset sale is pending unless the other
party has made an unsolicited, bona fide written offer to the 3dfx board of
directors to purchase all or some of the outstanding shares of 3dfx common
stock or all or substantially all of the assets of 3dfx on terms that the 3dfx
board of directors determines to be more favorable to its shareholders than the
terms of the asset sale and dissolution of 3dfx.

Expenses (Page 74)

   The purchase agreement provides that regardless of whether the asset sale is
completed, all expenses incurred by the parties shall be borne by the party
incurring such expenses, except in limited expressly defined instances where
the expenses are to be shared and except upon certain termination events as
referenced above.

Governmental Approvals (Page 54)

   The asset sale is subject to review by the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, to determine whether it complies with
applicable antitrust laws. Under the provisions of the HSR Act, the

                                       12
<PAGE>

asset sale may not be completed until the waiting period requirement of the HSR
Act has been satisfied. NVIDIA and 3dfx filed pre-transaction notification
reports, together with requests for early termination of the waiting period,
with the Department of Justice and the FTC under the HSR Act on January 10,
2001.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences (Pages 55 and 62)

   The asset sale and liquidation are taxable events to 3dfx. While 3dfx cannot
determine at this time its tax liability attributable to the asset sale and
liquidation, 3dfx expects that it may incur some alternative minimum tax
liability as a result of such events. The liquidation of 3dfx and the receipt
of any liquidating distributions by 3dfx shareholders will cause each
shareholder to recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes.

   Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the transactions
discussed in this prospectus/proxy statement to you will depend on the facts of
your own situation. You should consult your own tax advisor to fully understand
the tax consequences of the asset sale and dissolution of 3dfx to you.

Anticipated Accounting Treatment (Page 55)

   The asset sale is expected to be accounted for by NVIDIA as a "purchase" for
financial reporting purposes.

Absence of Dissenters' Rights (Pages 55 and 65)

   3dfx shareholders do not have dissenters' rights in connection with the
asset sale or the dissolution of 3dfx.

Recent Closing Prices

   The following table sets forth the closing per-share sales prices of NVIDIA
common stock and 3dfx common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market,
on December 15, 2000, the last full trading day before the public announcement
of the asset sale and the dissolution of 3dfx, and on         , 2001, the most

</TABLE>

   Following the transaction, NVIDIA common stock will continue to be listed on
the Nasdaq National Market. Since 3dfx's common stock no longer meets all of
the requirements for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, 3dfx's common stock
may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market in the near future. After
delisting, the ability to buy and sell shares of 3dfx common stock may be
materially impaired, which would likely have an adverse affect on the price and
liquidity of 3dfx common stock.

   Neither NVIDIA nor 3dfx has ever declared or paid cash dividends on its
common stock. The policy of NVIDIA is to retain earnings for use in its
businesses. While 3dfx intends to make one or more distributions to its
shareholders in connection with its dissolution, 3dfx cannot determine at this
time if it will be able to make any distributions.

            SUMMARY SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

   The following summary selected historical consolidated financial data should
be read in conjunction with NVIDIA's consolidated financial statements and
related notes and NVIDIA's "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations," which are incorporated by reference in
this prospectus/proxy statement. The statement of operations data for the year
ended December 31, 1997, the month ended January 31, 1998 and each of the years
in the two-year period ended January 30, 2000 and the balance sheet data as of
January 31, 1999 and January 30, 2000 have been derived from and should be read
in conjunction with NVIDIA's audited financial statements and the related
notes, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus/proxy statement.
The statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996
are derived from NVIDIA's audited financial statements and the related notes,

                             3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC.

            SUMMARY SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

   The following summary selected historical consolidated financial data should
be read in conjunction with 3dfx's consolidated financial statements and
related notes and 3dfx's "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations," which are incorporated by reference in
this prospectus/proxy statement. The consolidated statement of operations data
for each of the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2000, December 31, 1998
and December 31, 1997 and for the month ended January 31, 1999, and the
consolidated balance sheet data as of January 31, 2000 and December 31, 1998,
are derived from 3dfx's audited consolidated financial statements (as updated
in 3dfx's Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 26, 2001, the audit report
on which contains an explanatory paragraph relating to 3dfx's ability to
continue as a going concern as described in Note 14 to the consolidated
financial statements), which are incorporated by reference in this
prospectus/proxy statement. The consolidated statement of operations data for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995, and the consolidated
balance sheet data as of January 31, 1999, December 31, 1997, December 31,
1996, and December 31, 1995, are derived from 3dfx's audited consolidated
financial statements, which are not included or incorporated by reference in
this prospectus/proxy statement. The consolidated statement of operations data
for the nine months ended October 31, 2000 and October 31, 1999, and the
consolidated balance sheet data as of October 31, 2000, are derived from 3dfx's
unaudited financial statements, which are incorporated by reference in this
prospectus/proxy statement and which, in the opinion of management, include all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a
fair statement of the results for the unaudited interim periods. The historical
results presented below are not necessarily indicative of future results.

   Effective as of February 1, 1999, 3dfx changed its fiscal year from a fiscal
year beginning January 1 and ending December 31 to a fiscal year beginning
February 1 and ending January 31. The consolidated statement of operations data
below and consolidated balance sheet and other data below reflects 3dfx's
operations, including the following:

  .  In the quarter ended October 31, 2000, 3dfx took a $117.1 million charge
     for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. 3dfx's
     results of operations for the nine months ended October 31, 2000 and
     financial position at October 31, 2000 reflect the impact of this
     charge.

  .  3dfx's merger with GigaPixel Corporation, which was consummated in July
     2000, was treated as a purchase for financial reporting and accounting
     purposes. 3dfx's results of operations for the nine months ended October
     31, 2000 and financial position at October 31, 2000 reflect the impact
     of the GigaPixel merger.

  .  3dfx's merger with STB Systems, Inc., which was consummated in May 1999,
     was treated as a purchase for financial reporting and accounting
     purposes. 3dfx's results of operations for the year ended January 31,
     2000 and financial position at January 31, 2000 reflect the impact of
     the STB merger.

  .  In July 1998, 3dfx reached a settlement with Sega in conjunction with a
     lawsuit which 3dfx filed against Sega in August 1997. Fiscal 1998
     includes a one-time recognition of income based on the settlement.

  .  Fiscal 1997 includes $1.8 million of development contract revenues
     recognized under the Technology License and Development Agreement with
     Sega Enterprises, Ltd. No amount was recognized in any other period.

 SUMMARY SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   The following summary selected unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial information for NVIDIA has been derived from the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements which are included elsewhere in this
prospectus/proxy statement, which give effect to the acquisition of the 3dfx
assets under purchase accounting, and should be read in conjunction with the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the related
notes. For pro forma purposes, (1) NVIDIA's unaudited pro forma combined
condensed statements of operations for the nine months ended October 29, 2000
and the fiscal year ended January 30, 2000 are presented as if the purchase had
occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, and (2) NVIDIA's
unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of October 29, 2000 is
presented as if the purchase had occurred as of that date.

   The pro forma combined condensed financial statements should be read in
conjunction with NVIDIA's unaudited combined condensed financial statements and
related notes included in NVIDIA's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended October 29, 2000 and the audited and consolidated financial statements
and related notes incorporated by reference in NVIDIA's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2000. The pro forma information is
based on estimates and assumptions and may not necessarily be indicative of
what NVIDIA's results of operations or financial position would have been had
the asset sale been effected as of and for the periods presented, nor is such
information necessarily indicative of NVIDIA's results of operations or
financial position for any future period or date.

                                  RISK FACTORS

   When you decide whether to vote for approval of the dissolution of 3dfx and
the asset sale, you should consider the following factors in conjunction with
the other information included or incorporated by reference in this
prospectus/proxy statement. By voting to approve the dissolution of 3dfx and
the asset sale, you may be choosing to invest in NVIDIA common stock, although
there can be no assurance that following the completion of the dissolution of
3dfx any NVIDIA common stock will remain available for distribution to 3dfx
shareholders.

Risks Relating to the Asset Sale

If the purchase agreement were terminated under a number of circumstances,
including the failure of a majority in interest of 3dfx's shareholders to
approve the dissolution of 3dfx and the asset sale, 3dfx would incur costs and
NVIDIA would retain significant benefits related to 3dfx's assets.

   If the purchase agreement was terminated because 3dfx was unable to obtain
the approval of a majority in interest of its shareholders with respect to
either the dissolution of 3dfx or the asset sale, the asset sale is not
completed by May 15, 2001, or other circumstances arise entitling NVIDIA to
terminate the purchase agreement, 3dfx would be obligated to reimburse NVIDIA
US Investment Company for all reasonable fees and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, financial advisory fees and
filing fees, that have been paid or that may become payable by or on behalf of
NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company in connection with the preparation and
negotiation of the asset sale and related transactions.

   In addition, if a triggering event as defined under the purchase agreement
has occurred or if upon specific termination events there is in existence
another acquisition proposal, 3dfx would be obligated to pay NVIDIA US
Investment Company a nonrefundable fee of $3.3 million.

   Moreover, even if the purchase agreement was terminated for the reasons
mentioned above, NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company would retain
significant benefits related to 3dfx's assets, such as:

  .  NVIDIA US Investment Company would still own all of 3dfx's trademarks,
     tradenames, service marks, trademark applications and service mark
     applications received in connection with the credit agreement;

  .  3dfx would still be obligated to dismiss with prejudice its pending
     patent infringement lawsuit against NVIDIA;

  .  NVIDIA US Investment Company would retain the non-exclusive, royalty-
     free, fully-paid license to most of 3dfx's patents, patent applications
     and inventions pursuant to the patent license agreement; and

  .  3dfx and NVIDIA would be prevented from suing each other, or their
     respective subsidiaries, customers, distributors, users or others for
     infringement of most of their respective patents for a period of three
     years following December 15, 2000 pursuant to the patent standstill
     agreement.

Even if 3dfx's shareholders approve the asset sale, the asset sale may not be
completed and the value of 3dfx could be significantly diminished.

   The completion of the asset sale is subject to numerous conditions. Even if
a majority in interest of the shareholders of 3dfx vote to approve the asset
sale, 3dfx cannot guarantee that the asset sale will be completed. If it is not
completed, 3dfx would likely not be able to sell its assets to another buyer on
terms as favorable as those provided in the purchase agreement, or at all,
which would mean that less or no assets would be available for distribution to
3dfx's shareholders than if the asset sale had been completed. Further, the
termination of the purchase agreement under various circumstances would result
in 3dfx being obligated to pay various expenses and fees to NVIDIA. In
addition, even if the asset sale is not completed, NVIDIA would still own all
of 3dfx's trademarks, trade names, service marks, trademark applications, and
service mark applications and, in some circumstances, the 3dfx patent
infringement lawsuit against NVIDIA would be dismissed with prejudice,

                                       21
<PAGE>

NVIDIA would continue to benefit from a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free
license to most of 3dfx's patents, patent applications and inventions, and 3dfx
would be prevented from suing NVIDIA for infringement of some of its patents,
patent applications and inventions for a period of three years, with the result
of the foregoing being that the value of 3dfx's remaining assets would be
significantly diminished.

Whether or not the asset sale is completed, 3dfx may not be able to satisfy its
and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, and if the sale is not completed,
it is likely that 3dfx will file for or be forced into bankruptcy by its
creditors and no assets may be available for distribution to 3dfx shareholders.

   If the asset sale is not completed, 3dfx believes that it is likely that it
will file for or be forced to resort to bankruptcy protection. In this event,
it is extremely unlikely that 3dfx would be able to satisfy all of its and its
subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, and there would therefore be no assets
available for distribution to 3dfx's shareholders. Even if the parties complete
the asset sale, the proceeds provided by the transaction may not be sufficient
to satisfy all of 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' known and unknown debts and
liabilities. If the proceeds from the asset sale are insufficient to pay 3dfx's
and its subsidiaries' debts and other liabilities, it is likely that it will
file for or be forced to resort to bankruptcy protection. Further, if there are
insufficient proceeds from the asset sale to pay or otherwise provide for the
debts and liabilities of 3dfx and its subsidiaries, there will be no assets
available for distribution to 3dfx's shareholders.

The number and value of shares of NVIDIA common stock receivable in the asset
sale are uncertain.

   3dfx believes that if it is able to pay or provide for the payment of all of
its and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, 3dfx shareholders may receive
a portion of the 1,000,000 shares of NVIDIA common stock that are to be
delivered to 3dfx upon its dissolution. The number of shares deliverable to
3dfx may be reduced, however, if, after the closing of the asset sale, 3dfx
needs to receive additional funds of up to $25 million from NVIDIA US
Investment Company to pay, in full, all of the debts and liabilities of 3dfx
and its subsidiaries to their creditors. If NVIDIA US Investment Company
advances these additional funds to 3dfx, the 1,000,000 shares of NVIDIA common
stock would be reduced automatically by the number of shares equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the amount of the advances made by NVIDIA US
Investment Company by $50, regardless of the actual stock price of NVIDIA
common stock at the time of the advance.

   The purchase agreement does not provide for any adjustments in the number of
shares of NVIDIA common stock deliverable to 3dfx as a result of fluctuations
in the price of NVIDIA common stock. Accordingly, the number of shares that
3dfx will receive in the asset sale will not change, even if the market price
of NVIDIA common stock changes, except as set forth above with respect to the
potential $25 million advance. Recently, the stock market and, in particular,
the securities of technology companies like NVIDIA have experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations may adversely affect
the market price of NVIDIA common stock. The market price of NVIDIA common
stock at the time of any distribution to 3dfx's shareholders could be lower
than the market price on the date of the purchase agreement or the current
market price. A substantial amount of time may elapse before 3dfx makes a
distribution, if any, to its shareholders in connection with its dissolution.

If 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities substantially exceed the
cash proceeds from the asset sale, NVIDIA US Investment Company would not be
required to make an advance to 3dfx or deliver the stock consideration.

   Under the terms of the purchase agreement, NVIDIA US Investment Company is
only obligated to deliver shares of NVIDIA common stock to 3dfx upon 3dfx's
payment, or provision for the payment, of its and its subsidiaries' debts and
liabilities. If after the closing of the asset sale, 3dfx has expended all or
substantially all of the cash received from NVIDIA US Investment Company and
3dfx and its subsidiaries have over $25 million of remaining debts and
liabilities, NVIDIA US Investment Company would not be obligated to make

                                       22
<PAGE>

the advance to 3dfx of up to $25 million. In addition, if 3dfx is unable to
confirm to NVIDIA that it has paid, or otherwise provided for, its and its
subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, NVIDIA US Investment Company would not be
obligated under the purchase agreement to deliver to 3dfx any shares of NVIDIA
common stock.

If NVIDIA is not successful in integrating the 3dfx graphics business, NVIDIA's
operations may be affected.

   NVIDIA's ability to realize some of the anticipated benefits of the asset
sale will depend in part on NVIDIA's ability to integrate the assets purchased
from 3dfx into NVIDIA's current operations in a timely and efficient manner.
This integration may be difficult and unpredictable because NVIDIA's current
products are highly complex and have been developed independently from those of
3dfx. Successful integration requires coordination of different development and
engineering teams, as well as sales and marketing efforts and personnel. If
NVIDIA cannot successfully integrate the 3dfx assets with its operations,
NVIDIA may not realize some of the expected benefits of the asset sale.

Failure to hire and retain key employees could diminish the benefits of the
asset sale to NVIDIA.

   The successful integration of the 3dfx assets into NVIDIA's current business
operations will depend in part on the hiring and retention of personnel
critical to the business and operations of NVIDIA and the 3dfx graphics
business. Prior to its workforce reduction, 3dfx had personnel with technical
and engineering expertise which is in high demand and short supply. NVIDIA has
already added a number of 3dfx's former technical and engineering personnel to
its workforce. NVIDIA may be unable to retain management and technical and
engineering personnel that are critical to the successful integration of the
3dfx assets, which may result in loss of key information, expertise or know-how
and unanticipated additional recruiting and training costs and otherwise
diminishing anticipated benefits of the asset sale for NVIDIA and its
shareholders.

Failure to complete the asset sale could cause 3dfx's stock price to decline.

   If the asset sale is not completed, 3dfx's stock price may decline due to
any or all of the following potential consequences:

  . 3dfx may not be able to dispose of its assets for values equaling or
    exceeding those currently estimated by 3dfx; in particular, the assets
    that are the subject of the asset sale will likely be substantially
    diminished in value;

  . 3dfx may file for or be forced into bankruptcy;

  . 3dfx may become obligated to pay NVIDIA's and NVIDIA US Investment
    Company's expenses relating to the asset sale, plus a termination fee of
    $3.3 million;

  . 3dfx may still be obligated to continue the patent license granted to
    NVIDIA, to dismiss the pending patent litigation with NVIDIA with
    prejudice and be prevented from suing NVIDIA for infringement of its
    patents or other rights;

  . 3dfx's costs related to the asset sale, such as legal, accounting and
    financial advisor fees, must be paid even if the asset sale is not
    completed; and

  . 3dfx may have difficulty retaining its key remaining personnel.

In addition, if the asset sale is not completed, 3dfx's stock price may decline
to the extent that the current market price of 3dfx common stock reflects a
market assumption that the asset sale will be completed.

Certain regulatory agencies must approve the asset sale and could impose
conditions on, delay or refuse to approve the asset sale.

   To complete the asset sale, NVIDIA and 3dfx must obtain approvals or
consents from certain federal regulatory commissions and other government
agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the

                                       23

Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. These
agencies may seek to impose conditions on NVIDIA or 3dfx before giving their
approval or consent, and those conditions could harm NVIDIA's business
following the asset sale. In addition, a delay in obtaining the requisite
regulatory approvals will delay the completion of the asset sale. The companies
may be unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals, or obtain them
within the time frame contemplated in the purchase agreement.

Risks Relating to the Dissolution of 3dfx

3dfx cannot determine at this time the amount of distributions to its
shareholders, or whether any distributions will be made, because there are a
variety of factors, some of which are outside of 3dfx's control, that could
affect the ability of 3dfx to make distributions to its shareholders.

   3dfx cannot determine at this time the amount of or whether there will be
any distributions to its shareholders because that determination depends on a
variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the likelihood of closing
the asset sale, the net proceeds received in the asset sale, the value of
3dfx's other assets, the amount of 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' unknown debts
and liabilities to be paid in the future, the resolution of pending litigation
and other contingent liabilities, general business and economic conditions and
other matters. The amount of proceeds from the asset sale and the amount to be
distributed to 3dfx shareholders, if any, are subject to various significant
uncertainties, many of which are beyond 3dfx's control. See "The Plan of
Dissolution-Estimated Distributions" and "3dfx Interactive, Inc. Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (Unaudited)." Examples of uncertainties
that could reduce the value or eliminate distributions to 3dfx shareholders
include the following:

  . Changes in the anticipated net proceeds from the asset sale and the
    amount of 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities and the
    estimate of the costs and expenses of the asset sale and 3dfx's
    dissolution, including any resulting tax liabilities. If actual debts,
    liabilities, costs and expenses exceed 3dfx's expectations, actual net
    proceeds will be reduced and may result in no distributions to
    shareholders at all.

  . If liabilities of 3dfx or its subsidiaries that are unknown or contingent
    later arise or become fixed in amount and must be satisfied or reserved
    for as part of the dissolution.

  . If the net cash proceeds from the asset sale are insufficient to satisfy
    3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, 3dfx may receive an
    advance of up to $25 million from NVIDIA US Investment Company only if
    the advance will pay the remaining debts and liabilities. It is expected
    that 3dfx will need to request this advance to pay, or provide for the
    payment of, its known current and determinable debts and liabilities in
    full. If the advance is made, the number of shares of NVIDIA common stock
    receivable by 3dfx in the asset sale will be reduced.

  . Delays in completing the asset sale or the dissolution of 3dfx could
    result in additional expenses and result in no distributions to 3dfx
    shareholders. See "The Anticipated Timing of the Dissolution of 3dfx May
    Not Be Achieved."

  . A decline in the value of NVIDIA common stock.

   For the foregoing reasons, there can be no assurance that there will be any
distribution to shareholders, even if the asset sale is completed. See
"Forward-Looking Information."

The timing of the dissolution of 3dfx is not known and therefore 3dfx cannot
determine the timing of any distributions to its shareholders.

   Several factors affect the timing of 3dfx's ability to dissolve, including
the timing of the completion of the asset sale, the timing of the sale of
3dfx's remaining assets and 3dfx's ability to determine the amount of its and
its subsidiaries' known and unknown debts and liabilities. The purchase
agreement provides that the asset sale will close as soon as practicable, and
provides the parties with termination rights if the closing does not occur by
May 15, 2001. However, 3dfx cannot guarantee that the closing of the asset sale
will occur by that

                                       24
<PAGE>

date, or at all. NVIDIA is not obligated to complete the asset sale if a
majority in interest of 3dfx shareholders do not approve the dissolution of
3dfx. Any delay in the dissolution of 3dfx will result in a delay in making
distributions, if any, to 3dfx shareholders.

3dfx is unable to specify the type of assets that may be distributed to 3dfx's
shareholders, if any distribution is made.

   At the closing of the asset sale and upon the dissolution of 3dfx, 3dfx
expects to receive a combination of cash and shares of NVIDIA common stock.
Following the closing of the asset sale, 3dfx also expects to sell its
remaining assets, although it may not be successful in doing so. 3dfx may
distribute the shares of NVIDIA common stock received by it upon its
dissolution directly to its shareholders, or it may sell these shares in the
open market or contribute the shares to a liquidating trust for the benefit of
3dfx's shareholders. Further, 3dfx may elect to directly distribute shares of
NVIDIA common stock to some of its shareholders, while distributing an
equivalent per share value in cash to others who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fractional amount or small number of shares of NVIDIA common stock.
At this time, 3dfx is unable to provide specifics about the type of assets that
3dfx's shareholders may receive or what the value of those assets might be at
the time of distribution.

3dfx's shareholders could be required to return distributions if contingent
reserves are insufficient to satisfy 3dfx's liabilities.

   If 3dfx (or a liquidating trust to which 3dfx's assets are transferred)
makes a distribution to its shareholders but maintains inadequate reserves for
the payment of its and its subsidiaries debts and liabilities, each shareholder
could be required to return any additional amounts owed, up to the amount of
the total distribution that the shareholder received.

A distribution to 3dfx's shareholders could be delayed or diminished due to the
need to make adequate provisions for 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debt and
liabilities, including contingent liabilities associated with lawsuits and
threatened claims against 3dfx and its subsidiaries.

   The determination of whether a distribution is made and the amount of the
distribution depends on 3dfx's ability to pay, or provide for the payment of,
its and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, including contingent
liabilities related to lawsuits and threatened claims. If these contingent
liabilities later arise or become fixed in amount, 3dfx will be required to
pay, or provide for the payment of, such liabilities from any remaining assets.
This could result in the delay of distributions to 3dfx shareholders and the
substantial reduction or elimination of any distributions.

   If 3dfx's or its subsidiaries' creditors believe that 3dfx has not
adequately reserved assets for the payment of its or its subsidiaries' debts
and liabilities, these creditors may be able to obtain from a court an
injunction that prohibits 3dfx from making distributions to its shareholders.
This action could delay or substantially diminish the distributions to be made
to 3dfx's shareholders or holders of beneficial interests of the liquidating
trust, as the case may be.

3dfx may not be able to dispose of its remaining assets for values equaling or
exceeding those currently desired by 3dfx.

   Many factors affect the prices that 3dfx may receive for the assets not
being sold pursuant to the purchase agreement, including availability of buyers
for these assets and perceived quality of these assets. Many of these factors
are beyond 3dfx's control. In addition, if the asset sale does not close, the
value of the assets that were the subject of the purchase agreement will likely
be substantially diminished from the price agreed to by NVIDIA due to 3dfx's
termination of most of its employees, the general loss in value of intellectual
property in the graphics industry over time and the fact that 3dfx already sold
to NVIDIA US Investment Company its trademarks, tradenames, services marks and
related applications and, under some circumstances, the patent license granted
to NVIDIA would continue in effect and 3dfx's patent infringement lawsuit
against NVIDIA would be dismissed with prejudice. As a result of the foregoing,
3dfx may not be able to sell or otherwise dispose of its assets for prices
equaling or exceeding those desired by 3dfx or currently offered in the asset
sale.

                                       25

3dfx's board of directors may amend or delay implementation of the plan of
dissolution even if it is approved by 3dfx's shareholders.

   3dfx's board of directors has adopted a plan of dissolution for the
liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx following the completion of the
asset sale. Even if the dissolution is approved by 3dfx's shareholders, 3dfx's
board of directors has reserved the right, in its sole discretion, to amend or
delay implementation of the plan of dissolution unless it determines that the
amendment or delay would materially and adversely affect 3dfx's shareholders'
interests.

If the dissolution of 3dfx is approved by a majority in interest of 3dfx
shareholders, sales of the remaining assets would not be subject to shareholder
approval.

   If a majority of the 3dfx shareholders approve of the dissolution of 3dfx
and sale of the assets that are the subject of the asset sale, the 3dfx board
of directors would have broad authority to sell any or all of the remaining
assets of 3dfx on such terms as the board of directors determines advisable or
appropriate, even if those terms may not be acceptable to 3dfx shareholders.
3dfx shareholders would have no subsequent opportunity to vote on any
disposition of the remaining assets.

3dfx common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market.

   The trading price of 3dfx's common stock has declined significantly in
recent periods. If the trading price of 3dfx's common stock remains for an
extended period less than $1.00 per share, it is likely that the stock will be
delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. If this occurs, the 3dfx common stock
will likely be traded in the over-the-counter bulletin board of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or in the so-called "pink sheets." The
delisting of 3dfx's common stock would mean that, among other things, fewer
investors would have access to trade 3dfx's common stock, thus reducing demand
for the stock. In addition, 3dfx's common stock would be subject to penny stock
regulations, which could cause fewer brokers and market makers to execute
trades in 3dfx's common stock. These factors would likely cause 3dfx's common
stock price to further decrease.

   The penny stock regulations require that broker-dealers who recommend penny
stocks to persons other than institutional accredited investors must make a
special suitability determination for the purchaser, receive the purchaser's
written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale and provide the
purchaser with risk disclosure documents that identify risks associated with
investing in penny stocks. Furthermore, the broker-dealer must obtain a signed
and dated acknowledgement from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser
has actually received the required risk disclosure document before effecting a
transaction in penny stock. These requirements have historically resulted in
reducing the level of trading activity in securities that become subject to the
penny stock rules. Holders of 3dfx's common stock would likely find it more
difficult to sell their shares of common stock, which would likely have an
adverse effect of the market price of the common stock.

3dfx is at risk of securities class action litigation due to its stock price
volatility.

   Historically, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its
securities. 3dfx may be the target of litigation like this. Securities
litigation would result in substantial costs and divert management's attention
and resources, which would seriously harm 3dfx's ability to complete the asset
sale and the dissolution and may reduce or eliminate the assets available for
distribution to 3dfx shareholders.

Risks Relating to NVIDIA

NVIDIA's operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate.

   Many of NVIDIA's revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict,
and NVIDIA's operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any
particular period. It is therefore difficult for NVIDIA to

                                       26
<PAGE>

accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses. As a result, it is possible
that in some quarters NVIDIA's operating results could be below the
expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause the
trading price of NVIDIA's common stock to decline, perhaps substantially.
NVIDIA believes that its quarterly and annual results of operations will be
affected by a variety of factors that could adversely affect its revenue, gross
profit and results of operations.

   Factors that have affected NVIDIA's results of operations in the past, and
are likely to affect NVIDIA's results of operations in the future, include the
following:


  . demand and market acceptance for NVIDIA's products and/or NVIDIA's
    customers' products;

  . the successful development and volume production of next-generation
    products;

  . new product announcements or product introductions by NVIDIA's
    competitors;

  . NVIDIA's ability to introduce new products in accordance with original
    equipment manufacturer, or OEM, design requirements and design cycles;

  . changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the
    introduction of NVIDIA's customers' products;

  . fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or
    manufacturing yields;

  . competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling
    prices;

  . rates of product return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to
    quality issues;

  . the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders;

  . the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic
    relationship;

  . seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC market;

  . substantial disruption in NVIDIA's suppliers' operations, either as a
    result of a natural disaster, equipment failure or other cause;

  . supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components
    incorporated into NVIDIA's customers' products, including memory devices;

  . NVIDIA's ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of its products;

  . legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property;

  . bad debt write-offs;

  . unexpected inventory write-downs; and

  . introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster
    generations of processors and controllers.

   Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent NVIDIA from
achieving its expected future revenue or net income.

   Because most operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term,
NVIDIA may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to
compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall. NVIDIA may be required to reduce
prices in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. If new
competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other
competitive factors require NVIDIA to invest significantly greater resources
than anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts,
NVIDIA's business could suffer. Accordingly, NVIDIA believes that period-to-
period comparisons of NVIDIA's results of operations should not be relied upon
as an indication of future performance. In addition, the results of any
quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal
year.

                                       27

NVIDIA's 3D graphics solution may not continue to be accepted by the PC market.

   NVIDIA's success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of
NVIDIA's 3D graphics processors for high performance 3D graphics in PC
applications. The market for 3D graphics processors has been characterized by
unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often
caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in
dynamic random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system
cost of add-in boards, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent
new technology and product introductions. Only a small number of products have
achieved broad market acceptance and this market acceptance, if achieved, is
difficult to sustain due to intense competition. Since NVIDIA has no other
product line, NVIDIA's business would suffer if for any reason its current or
future 3D graphics processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance
in the PC market. If NVIDIA is unable to complete the timely development of or
successfully and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet
the requirements of the PC market, NVIDIA's business would be harmed.

NVIDIA's integrated graphics product may not be accepted by the PC market.

   NVIDIA expects that integrated graphics chipset products will become an
increasing part of the lower cost segment of the PC graphics market. NVIDIA is
currently developing integrated chipset products. If these products are not
competitive in this segment and the integrated chipset segment continues to
account for an increasing percentage of the units sold in the PC market,
NVIDIA's business may suffer.

NVIDIA needs to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order
to succeed.

   NVIDIA's business will depend to a significant extent on NVIDIA's ability to
successfully develop new products for the 3D graphics market. NVIDIA's add-in
board manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new system
configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and fall
design cycles. Accordingly, NVIDIA's existing products must have competitive
performance levels or NVIDIA must introduce new products on a timely basis with
such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system
configurations. This requires that NVIDIA do the following:

  . anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand;

  . incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the
    exacting design requirements of PC OEMs and add-in board manufacturers or
    contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs,

  . price its products competitively; and

  . introduce the products to the market within the limited window for PC
    OEMs and add-in board manufacturers.

   As a result, NVIDIA believes that significant expenditures for research and
development will continue to be required in the future. The success of new
product introductions will depend on several factors, including the following:

  . proper new product definition;

  . timely completion and introduction of new product designs;

  . the ability of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, NVIDIA's
    primary manufacturer, and any additional third-party manufacturers to
    effectively manufacture NVIDIA's new products in a timely manner;

  . the quality of any new products;

  . differentiation of new products from those of NVIDIA's competitors;

  . market acceptance of NVIDIA's and NVIDIA's customers' products; and

  . availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of
    memory products.

                                       28
<PAGE>

   NVIDIA's strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process
technology appropriate for its products and available from commercial third-
party foundries. Use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial
yield problems. New products that NVIDIA introduces may not incorporate the
features and functionality demanded by PC OEMs, add-in board manufacturers and
consumers of 3D graphics. In addition, NVIDIA may not successfully develop or
introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to
meet both the PC OEMs' design cycles and market demand. NVIDIA has in the past
experienced delays in the development of some new products. NVIDIA's failure to
successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance for new 3D
graphics products would harm NVIDIA's business.

NVIDIA's failure to identify new product opportunities or to develop new
products could harm its business.

   As markets for NVIDIA's 3D graphics processors develop and competition
increases, NVIDIA anticipates that product life cycles at the high end will
remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline. In
particular, NVIDIA expects average selling prices and gross margins for
NVIDIA's 3D graphics processors to decline as each product matures and as unit
volume increases. As a result, NVIDIA will need to introduce new products and
enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices
and gross margins. In order for NVIDIA's 3D graphics processors to achieve high
volumes, leading PC OEMs and add-in board manufacturers must select NVIDIA's 3D
graphics processor for design into their products and then successfully
complete the designs of their products and sell them. NVIDIA may be unable to
successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to
market in a timely fashion any new products. In addition, NVIDIA cannot
guarantee that any new products it develops will be selected for design into PC
OEMs' and add-in board manufacturers' products, that any new designs will be
successfully completed or that any new products will be sold. As the complexity
of NVIDIA's products and the manufacturing process for products increases,
there is an increasing risk that it will experience problems with the
performance of products and that there will be delays in the development,
introduction or volume shipment of its products. NVIDIA may experience
difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other
factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products it develops.
In addition, NVIDIA may be unable to successfully manage the production
transition risks with respect to future products. Failure to achieve any of the
foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result
in rapidly declining average selling prices, reduced margins, and reduced
demand for products or loss of market share. In addition, technologies
developed by others may render NVIDIA's 3D graphics products non-competitive or
obsolete or result in NVIDIA's holding excess inventory, either of which would
harm NVIDIA's business.

NVIDIA relies on third-party vendors to supply tools for the development of
NVIDIA's new products and NVIDIA may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to
develop these products.

   In the design and development of new products and product enhancements,
NVIDIA relies on third-party software development tools. While NVIDIA currently
is not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools, some or all
of these tools may not be readily available in the future. For example, NVIDIA
has experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result
of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate
the complex features and functionalities of NVIDIA's products. The design
requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater
functionality from 3D graphics products in the future may exceed the
capabilities of the software development tools available to NVIDIA. If the
software development tools NVIDIA uses become unavailable or fail to produce
designs that meet consumer demands, NVIDIA's business could suffer.

NVIDIA's industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial
costs to NVIDIA.

   The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and
pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions, which has resulted in
protracted and expensive litigation. The 3D graphics market in particular has
been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property
positions, and

                                       29
<PAGE>

NVIDIA expects NVIDIA's competitors to continue to pursue aggressive
intellectual property positions. In addition, from time to time NVIDIA receives
notices alleging that NVIDIA has infringed patents or other intellectual
property rights owned by third parties. NVIDIA expects that, as the number of
issued hardware and software patents increases, and as competition in NVIDIA's
markets intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims
will increase. If infringement claims are made against NVIDIA, NVIDIA may seek
licenses under the claimant's patents or other intellectual property rights.
However, licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to NVIDIA.
The failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by
NVIDIA could cause it to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the
manufacture of products. Furthermore, NVIDIA may initiate claims or litigation
against third parties for infringement of NVIDIA's proprietary rights or to
establish the validity of NVIDIA's proprietary rights. NVIDIA has agreed to
indemnify certain customers for claims of infringement arising out of sale of
NVIDIA's products.

Litigation by or against NVIDIA or NVIDIA's customers concerning infringement
would likely result in significant expense to NVIDIA and divert the efforts of
NVIDIA's technical and management personnel, whether or not the litigation
results in a favorable determination for NVIDIA.

   3dfx and NVIDIA have filed patent infringement lawsuits against the other,
and, pursuant to the purchase agreement and patent standstill agreement, the
lawsuits were stayed as of January 5, 2001. The lawsuits will both be dismissed
with prejudice upon the closing of the asset sale, and may be dismissed with
prejudice even if the purchase agreement is terminated under specific
circumstances, including the failure of 3dfx's shareholders to approve the
asset sale.

   The amended complaint filed by 3dfx alleges that NVIDIA's RIVA TNT, RIVA
TNT2 and RIVA TNT2 Ultra products infringe some of 3dfx's patents and seeks
unspecified compensatory and trebled damages and attorneys' fees, as well as
injunctive relief. NVIDIA's current generation of products is not identified as
infringing any of the patents in suit. On August 28, 2000, NVIDIA filed a
patent infringement lawsuit against 3dfx in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California. The NVIDIA lawsuit alleges that 3dfx's
graphics chip and card products, which are used to accelerate 3D graphics on
personal computers, infringe five of NVIDIA's patents and seeks an injunction
restraining 3dfx from manufacturing, selling or importing infringing graphics
chip and card products including its Voodoo 3, Voodoo 4, Voodoo 5 and VSA-100
family of products, as well as monetary damages.

   NVIDIA has in the past been subject to patent infringement suits with SGI
and S3 Incorporated, both of which were settled and resulted in cross-licenses
and, in the case of SGI, payments by NVIDIA. In addition, NVIDIA may be subject
to patent infringement suits brought by other parties in the future. For
example, NVIDIA has been advised by Rambus Inc. that it believes NVIDIA's
products infringe certain patents owned by Rambus and Rambus has requested that
NVIDIA agree to certain licensing terms, including royalty payments. NVIDIA
believes the Rambus patents are invalid, not infringed and unenforceable.
Although NVIDIA currently is having discussions with Rambus regarding potential
business alternatives to Rambus' proposed licensing terms, NVIDIA cannot
guarantee that it will be able to reach a satisfactory agreement with Rambus.
If NVIDIA is unable to do so, Rambus may sue NVIDIA or NVIDIA's customers for
patent infringement at any time.

   NVIDIA could be subject to future lawsuits that could divert NVIDIA's
resources and result in the payment of substantial damages.

NVIDIA may be unable to adequately protect NVIDIA's intellectual property.

   NVIDIA relies primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights,
trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing
arrangements to protect NVIDIA's intellectual property. NVIDIA owns 33 issued
United States patents, and has 57 United States patent applications pending.
NVIDIA's issued patents have expiration dates from April 2015 to April 2018.
NVIDIA's issued patents and pending patent applications relate to technology
developed by NVIDIA in connection with the development of NVIDIA's former and
current products, including its 3D graphics processors. NVIDIA's pending patent

                                       30
<PAGE>

applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any
issued patents may not provide NVIDIA with competitive advantages or may be
challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents of others may harm
NVIDIA's ability to conduct NVIDIA's business. Others may independently develop
substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to
NVIDIA's trade secrets or intellectual property, or disclose NVIDIA's
intellectual property or trade secrets. NVIDIA's failure to effectively protect
NVIDIA's intellectual property could harm NVIDIA's business. NVIDIA has
licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in NVIDIA's graphics
processors, and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future
products. These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the
cross-license of technology by NVIDIA or payment of other consideration. If
these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, NVIDIA's
business could suffer.

NVIDIA's failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm NVIDIA's
business.

   NVIDIA's future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins,
which entails having its existing and future products chosen as the 3D graphics
processors for hardware components or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs and
motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. NVIDIA's add-in board manufacturers
and major OEM customers typically introduce new high-end system configurations
as often as twice per year, generally based on spring and fall design cycles.
Accordingly, NVIDIA's existing products must have competitive performance
levels or NVIDIA must timely introduce new products with such performance
characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations. NVIDIA's
failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm NVIDIA's business. The
process of being qualified for inclusion in a PC OEM's product can be lengthy
and could cause NVIDIA to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a
particular product feature, which also could harm NVIDIA's business.

   NVIDIA's ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on its ability
to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards.
Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render NVIDIA's products
incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and
software developers, including Intel and Microsoft. This would require NVIDIA
to invest significant time and resources to redesign its products to ensure
compliance with relevant standards. If NVIDIA's products are not in compliance
with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, its
ability to achieve design wins could suffer.

NVIDIA is dependent on the PC market, which may not continue to grow.

   In fiscal 2000, NVIDIA derived all of its revenue from the sale of products
for use in PCs. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2001, NVIDIA derived most
of its revenue from the sale of products for use in the entire desktop PC
market, from professional workstations to low-cost PCs. NVIDIA expects to
continue to derive most of its revenue from the sale or license of products for
use in PCs in the next several years. The PC market is characterized by rapidly
changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product
introductions and significant price competition. These factors result in short
product life cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the
life of a specific product. Although the PC market has grown substantially in
recent years, this growth may not continue. A reduction in sales of PCs, or a
reduction in the growth rate of PC sales, would likely reduce demand for
NVIDIA's products. Moreover, changes in demand could be large and sudden. Since
PC manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth,
they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have
incorrectly forecast product transitions. In these cases, PC manufacturers may
abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from
suppliers like NVIDIA until the excess inventory has been absorbed. Any
reduction in the demand for PCs generally, or for a particular product that
incorporates NVIDIA's 3D graphic processors, could harm NVIDIA's business.

The acceptance of next generation products in business PC 3D graphics may not
continue to develop.

   NVIDIA's success will depend in part upon the demand for performance 3D
graphics for business PC applications. The market for performance 3D graphics
on business PCs has only recently begun to emerge and

                                       31
<PAGE>

is dependent on the future development of, and substantial end-user and OEM
demand for, 3D graphics functionality. As a result, the market for business PC
3D graphics computing may not continue to develop or may not grow at a rate
sufficient to support NVIDIA's business. The development of the market for
performance 3D graphics on business PCs will in turn depend on the development
and availability of a large number of business PC software applications that
support or take advantage of performance 3D graphics capabilities. Currently
there are only a limited number of software applications like this, most of
which are games, and a broader base of software applications may not develop in
the near term or at all. Consequently, a broad market for full function
performance 3D graphics on business PCs may not develop. NVIDIA's business
prospects will suffer if the market for business PC 3D graphics fails to
develop or develops more slowly than expected.

NVIDIA is dependent on a small number of customers and NVIDIA is subject to
order and shipment uncertainties.

   NVIDIA has only a limited number of customers and its sales are highly
concentrated. NVIDIA primarily sells its products to add-in board and
motherboard manufacturers and CEMs, which incorporate graphics products in the
boards they sell to PC OEMs. Sales to add-in board manufacturers and CEMs are
primarily dependent on achieving design wins with leading PC OEMs. The number
of add-in board manufacturers and CEMs and leading PC OEMs is limited. NVIDIA
expects that a small number of add-in board manufacturers and CEMs directly,
and a small number of PC OEMs indirectly, will continue to account for a
substantial portion of NVIDIA's revenue for the foreseeable future. As a
result, NVIDIA's business could be harmed by the loss of business from PC OEMs
or add-in board manufacturers and CEMs. In addition, revenue from add-in board
manufacturers, motherboard manufacturers, CEMs and PC OEMs that have directly
or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods, individually
or as a group, may not continue, or may not reach or exceed historical levels
in any future period.

   NVIDIA's business may be harmed by instability in Asia due to the
concentration of customers who are located or have substantial operations in
Asia, including Taiwan. The People's Republic of China and Taiwan have in the
past experienced and currently are experiencing strained relations. A worsening
of these relations or the development of hostilities between the two could
result in disruptions in Taiwan and possibly other areas of Asia, which could
harm NVIDIA's business. While NVIDIA believes political instability in Asia has
not adversely affected NVIDIA's business, because of NVIDIA's reliance on
companies with operations in Asia, continued economic and political instability
in Asia might harm it.

NVIDIA may be unable to manage its growth and, as a result, may be unable to
successfully implement NVIDIA's strategy.

   NVIDIA's rapid growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a
significant strain on NVIDIA's managerial, operational and financial resources.
As of January 1, 2001, NVIDIA had 765 employees as compared to 392 employees as
of January 30, 2000. NVIDIA expects that the number of its employees will
increase substantially over the next 12 months. NVIDIA's future growth, if any,
will depend on its ability to continue to implement and improve operational,
financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis, as
well as NVIDIA's ability to maintain effective cost controls. Further, NVIDIA
will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and
other third parties. NVIDIA's systems, procedures or controls may not be
adequate to support its operations and NVIDIA's management may be unable to
achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement NVIDIA's
strategy.

NVIDIA is dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm
NVIDIA's business.

   NVIDIA's performance will be substantially dependent on the performance of
NVIDIA's executive officers and key employees. None of NVIDIA's officers or
employees is bound by an employment agreement, and NVIDIA's relationships with
these officers and employees are, therefore, at will. NVIDIA does not have "key
person" life insurance policies on any of NVIDIA's employees. The loss of the
services of any of

                                       32
<PAGE>

NVIDIA's executive officers, technical personnel or other key employees,
particularly Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA's President and Chief Executive Officer,
would harm NVIDIA's business. NVIDIA's success will depend on NVIDIA's ability
to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial
personnel. NVIDIA's failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and
managerial personnel would harm its business.

NVIDIA depends on third-party fabrication to produce NVIDIA's products.

   NVIDIA does not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for NVIDIA's
products and does not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. NVIDIA's
products require wafers manufactured with state-of-the-art fabrication
equipment and techniques. NVIDIA utilizes TSMC and WaferTech to produce its
semiconductor wafers and utilizes independent contractors to perform assembly,
testing and packaging. NVIDIA depends on these suppliers to allocate to it a
portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet NVIDIA's needs, to
produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields,
and to deliver those products to it on a timely basis. These manufacturers may
be unable to meet NVIDIA's near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements.
NVIDIA obtains manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and TSMC has no
obligation to provide it with any specified minimum quantities of product. TSMC
fabricates wafers for other companies, including certain of NVIDIA's
competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce
or eliminate deliveries to it on short notice. Because the lead time needed to
establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be
several quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply
for any specific product. NVIDIA believes that long-term market acceptance for
NVIDIA's products will depend on reliable relationships with TSMC and any other
manufacturers used by NVIDIA to ensure adequate product supply to respond to
customer demand.

   In September 1999, a significant earthquake in Taiwan contributed to a
temporary shortage of graphics processors in the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 2000. Because of NVIDIA's reliance on TSMC, NVIDIA's business may be
harmed by political instability in Taiwan, including the worsening of the
strained relations between The People's Republic of China and Taiwan.
Furthermore, any substantial disruption in NVIDIA's suppliers' operations,
either as a result of a natural disaster, political unrest, economic
instability, equipment failure or other cause, could harm NVIDIA's business.

   NVIDIA is dependent primarily on TSMC and NVIDIA expects in the future to
continue to be dependent upon third-party manufacturers to do the following:

  .  produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing
     yields;

  .  deliver those wafers to NVIDIA and its independent assembly and testing
     subcontractors on a timely basis; and

  .  allocate to NVIDIA a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient
     to meet NVIDIA's needs.

   NVIDIA's wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total
production capacity of TSMC. Although NVIDIA's products are designed using
TSMC's process design rules, TSMC may be unable to achieve or maintain
acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis
and/or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, TSMC may not continue to devote
resources to the production of NVIDIA's products, or to advance the process
design technologies on which the manufacturing of NVIDIA's products is based.
Any difficulties like these would harm NVIDIA's business.

Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields would reduce NVIDIA's product
supply and harm NVIDIA's business.

   Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design,
which is developed largely by NVIDIA, and process technology, which typically
is proprietary to the manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either
design or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively
determined or

                                       33
<PAGE>

resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to
identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a
result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production
process, and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and
communication between the manufacturer and NVIDIA.

   The risk of low yields is compounded by the offshore location of most of
NVIDIA's manufacturers, increasing the effort and time required to identify,
communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Because of NVIDIA's
potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from NVIDIA's
manufacturers, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase
in NVIDIA's per unit costs and force NVIDIA to allocate its available product
supply among its customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships
as well as revenue and gross profit. NVIDIA's wafer manufacturers may be unable
to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. NVIDIA's
inability to achieve planned yields from NVIDIA's wafer manufacturers could
harm NVIDIA's business. NVIDIA also faces the risk of product recalls or
product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not
discovered during the manufacturing and testing process. In the event of a
significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall, NVIDIA's
business could suffer.

Failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect
NVIDIA's ability to compete effectively.

   NVIDIA's strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process
technology appropriate for NVIDIA's products and available from commercial
third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes may have greater risk of
initial yield problems. Manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid
change and require significant expenditures for research and development.
NVIDIA continuously evaluates the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry
process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. NVIDIA
has migrated to the .18 micron technology with the GeForce2 GTS GPUs, and
NVIDIA believes that the transition of its products to increasingly smaller
geometries will be important to NVIDIA's competitive position. NVIDIA intends
to migrate to the .15 micron technology for future products. Other companies in
the industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing
processes and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product
deliveries and increased expense levels. NVIDIA may experience similar
difficulties and the corresponding negative effects. Moreover, NVIDIA is
dependent on NVIDIA's relationships with NVIDIA's third-party manufacturers to
migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully. NVIDIA may be unable to
migrate to new manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely
basis.

The 3D graphics industry is highly competitive, and NVIDIA may be unable to
compete.

   The market for 3D graphics processors for PCs in which NVIDIA competes is
intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change,
evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. NVIDIA
believes that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,
breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels,
backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs,
manufacturing capabilities, price of graphics processors and total system costs
of add-in boards and motherboards. NVIDIA expects competition to increase both
from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be
less costly than NVIDIA's 3D graphics processors or may provide better
performance or additional features not provided by NVIDIA's products.

   NVIDIA's primary source of competition is from companies that provide or
intend to provide 3D graphics solutions for the PC market. NVIDIA's competitors
include the following:

  .  suppliers of graphics add-in boards that utilize their internally
     developed graphics chips, such as ATI Technologies Inc. and Matrox
     Electronics Systems Ltd.;

  .  suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate 2D and 3D
     graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as
     Intel, Silicon Integrated Systems and VIA Technologies;

                                       34
<PAGE>

  .  companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market and
     provide high end 3D solutions for PCs and workstations, including 3DLabs
     Inc., SGI and Evans and Sutherland Computer Corporation; and

  .  companies that focus on the video game market, such as VideoLogic Group
     plc.

   If and to the extent NVIDIA offers products outside of the 3D graphics
processor market, NVIDIA may face competition from some of NVIDIA's existing
competitors as well as from companies with which NVIDIA currently does not
compete. NVIDIA cannot accurately predict if it will compete successfully in
any new markets it may enter.

NVIDIA may compete with Intel in the integrated low-cost chipset market.

   In June 2000, Intel began shipping the Intel 815 and 815e 3D graphics
chipsets that are targeted at the low-cost PC market. Intel has significantly
greater resources than NVIDIA does, and NVIDIA's products may not compete
effectively against future products introduced by Intel. In addition, NVIDIA
may be unable to compete effectively against Intel or Intel may introduce
additional products that are competitive with NVIDIA's products in either
performance or price or both. NVIDIA expects Intel to continue to do the
following:

  .  invest heavily in research and development and new manufacturing
     facilities;

  .  maintain its position as the largest manufacturer of PC microprocessors;

  .  increasingly dominate the PC platform; and

  .  promote its product offerings through advertising campaigns designed to
     engender brand loyalty among PC users.

   Intel may in the future develop graphics add-in cards or graphics-enabled
motherboards that could directly compete with graphics add-in cards or
graphics-enabled motherboards based on NVIDIA's product. In addition, due to
the widespread industry acceptance of Intel's microprocessor architecture and
interface architecture, including its AGP, and Intel's intellectual property
position with respect to such architecture, Intel exercises significant
influence over the PC industry generally. Any significant modifications by
Intel to the AGP, the microprocessor or core logic components or other aspects
of the PC microprocessor architecture could result in incompatibility with
NVIDIA's technology, which would harm NVIDIA's business. In addition, any delay
in the public release of information relating to modifications like this could
harm NVIDIA's business.

NVIDIA is dependent on third parties for assembly and testing of NVIDIA's
products.

   NVIDIA's graphics processors are assembled and tested by Advance
Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., ChipPAC Incorporated and Siliconware Precision
Industries Company Ltd., all of which are based in Asia. Because NVIDIA relies
on Asian assembly and test subcontractors, NVIDIA's business may be harmed by
political instability in Asia, including the worsening of the strained
relations between The People's Republic of China and Taiwan. NVIDIA does not
have long-term agreements with any of these subcontractors. As a result of
NVIDIA's dependence on third-party subcontractors for assembly and testing of
NVIDIA's products, NVIDIA does not directly control product delivery schedules
or product quality. Any product shortages or quality assurance problems could
increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing of NVIDIA's products and
could harm NVIDIA's business. Due to the amount of time typically required to
qualify assemblers and testers, NVIDIA could experience significant delays in
the shipment of its products if it is required to find alternative third
parties to assemble or test NVIDIA's products or components. Any delays in
delivery of NVIDIA's products could harm its business.

NVIDIA is subject to risks associated with product defects and
incompatibilities.

   Products as complex as NVIDIA's may contain defects or failures when
introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are
released. NVIDIA has in the past discovered software defects and

                                       35
<PAGE>

incompatibilities with customers' hardware in certain of its products and may
experience delays or lost revenue to correct any new defects in the future.
Errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments
could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance.
NVIDIA's products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to
beginning volume production and distribution. As a result, NVIDIA's products
may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and
distribution. The widespread production and distribution of defective products
could harm NVIDIA's business.

NVIDIA is subject to risks associated with international operations.

   NVIDIA's reliance on foreign third-party manufacturing, assembly and testing
operations subjects NVIDIA to a number of risks associated with conducting
business outside of the United States, including the following:

  . unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory
    requirements;

  . delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain
    technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;

  . longer payment cycles;

  . imposition of additional taxes and penalties;

  . the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and

  . other factors beyond NVIDIA's control.

   NVIDIA also is subject to general political risks in connection with
NVIDIA's international trade relationships. In addition, the laws of certain
foreign countries in which NVIDIA's products are or may be manufactured or
sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect NVIDIA's products or
intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United
States. This makes the possibility of piracy of NVIDIA's technology and
products more likely. Currently, all of NVIDIA's arrangements with third-party
manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars and to date
NVIDIA has not engaged in any currency hedging activities, although NVIDIA may
do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm
NVIDIA's business in the future.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature.

   The semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by the
following factors:

  . rapid technological change;

  . cyclical market patterns;

  . significant average selling price erosion;

  . fluctuating inventory levels;

  . alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints; and

  . variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures
    for capital equipment and product development.

   In addition, the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at
various times, characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated
erosion of average selling prices. NVIDIA may experience substantial period-to-
period fluctuations in results of operations due to general semiconductor
industry conditions.

                                       36

Failure in implementation of NVIDIA's enterprise resource planning system could
adversely affect NVIDIA's operations.

   In December 1999, NVIDIA began the implementation of an SAP A.G. system as
NVIDIA's enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to replace NVIDIA's
information systems in business, finance, operations and service. The first
phase of the implementation was successfully completed in June 2000 and
NVIDIA's operations are fully functioning under the new ERP system. Future
phases of the implementation are expected to occur throughout fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2002. NVIDIA is heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of
NVIDIA's internal systems to conduct NVIDIA's business. System failure or
malfunctioning may result in disruptions of operations and inability to process
transactions. NVIDIA's results of operations and financial position could be
adversely affected if NVIDIA encounters unforeseen problems with respect to
system operations or future implementation.

Some provisions in NVIDIA's certificate of incorporation, NVIDIA's bylaws and
NVIDIA's agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.

   NVIDIA's certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that
could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of
NVIDIA's outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:

  . the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock
    without prior shareholder approval;

  . the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;

  . a classified board of directors; and

  . advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder
    proposals.

   On March 5, 2000, NVIDIA entered into a licensing and development agreement
with Microsoft that included a grant to Microsoft of first and last rights of
refusal over any offer NVIDIA receives to purchase 30% or more of the
outstanding shares of NVIDIA's common stock. This provision could also delay or
prevent a change in control of NVIDIA.

NVIDIA's stock price may continue to experience large short-term fluctuations.

   The price of NVIDIA's common stock has fluctuated greatly. These price
fluctuations have been rapid and severe. The price of NVIDIA's common stock may
continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors related to the
general volatility that currently exists in the market or due to a variety of
company specific factors, including quarter to quarter variations in NVIDIA's
operating results, shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by
securities analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk
factors. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company's stock, securities class action litigation has been initiated against
the issuing company. This type of litigation could result in substantial cost
and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could have an
adverse effect on NVIDIA's revenues and earnings. Any adverse determination in
this type of litigation could also subject NVIDIA to significant liabilities.
See "Risks Relating to NVIDIA--NVIDIA's operating results are unpredictable and
may fluctuate."

                            THE 3DFX SPECIAL MEETING

When and Where the Meeting Will Be Held

   This prospectus/proxy statement is being furnished to 3dfx shareholders as
part of the solicitation of proxies by the 3dfx board of directors for use at
the 3dfx special meeting to be held on       , 2001 at 8:00 a.m., local time at
          , and at any adjournments or postponements thereof.

   This prospectus/proxy statement, and the accompanying proxy card, are first
being mailed to holders of 3dfx common stock on or about       , 2001.

What Will Be Voted Upon

   The purpose of the 3dfx special meeting is to consider and vote upon the
following proposals:

  . to approve the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx as
    described in the plan of dissolution; and

  . if the dissolution of 3dfx is approved, to approve the principal terms of
    the purchase agreement under which 3dfx will sell certain of its assets
    to NVIDIA US Investment Company.

   The proposal to approve the plan of dissolution will first be presented to
3dfx's shareholders. If it is approved, the proposal to approve the asset sale
will then be presented to 3dfx's shareholders.

   The 3dfx board of directors does not presently intend to bring any business
before the 3dfx meeting other than the specific proposals referred to above and
specified in the notice of the 3dfx special meeting. The 3dfx board of
directors knows of no other matters that are to be brought before the 3dfx
special meeting. If any other business properly comes before the 3dfx special
meeting, including the consideration of a motion to adjourn such meeting
(including for purposes of soliciting additional votes), it is the intention of
the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy to vote the shares they
represent as the 3dfx board of directors may recommend.

Which Shareholders May Vote

   Only holders of record of 3dfx common stock at the close of business on
      , 2001, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the
3dfx special meeting. As of the close of business on the 3dfx record date,
there were      shares of 3dfx common stock outstanding and entitled to vote,
held of record by      shareholders. A majority, or      of these shares,
present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business.

How Do 3dfx Shareholders Vote

   The 3dfx proxy card accompanying this prospectus/proxy statement is
solicited on behalf of the 3dfx board of directors for use at the 3dfx special
meeting. 3dfx shareholders are requested to complete, date and sign the
accompanying proxy and promptly return it in the accompanying envelope or
otherwise mail it to 3dfx. If your shares of 3dfx common stock are held in
street name through a broker or other custodian, you may also vote by telephone
or by using the Internet by following the instructions included with your proxy
card. All proxies that are properly executed and returned, and that are not
revoked, will be voted at the 3dfx meeting in accordance with the instructions
indicated thereon. Executed but unmarked proxies will be voted for approval and
adoption of all of the matters listed on the proxy card.

                                       38
<PAGE>

How to Change Your Vote

   A 3dfx shareholder who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time before it
is exercised at the 3dfx special meeting, by doing one of the following:

  . delivering a written notice of revocation to Mr. Richard A. Heddleson,
    Chief Financial Officer, 3dfx Interactive, Inc., 4435 Fortran Drive, San
    Jose, California 95134,

  . executing a subsequently dated proxy and delivering it to Mr. Richard A.
    Heddleson, Chief Financial Officer, 3dfx Interactive, Inc., 4435 Fortran
    Drive, San Jose, California 95134,

  . delivering different instructions by phone or Internet, or

  . attending the 3dfx special meeting and voting in person.

   Attending the 3dfx special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy. In
order to revoke a proxy, the 3dfx shareholder must also vote at the meeting.

Vote Required to Approve Each Proposal

   Under California law and the charter documents of 3dfx, approval of the
liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx as described in the plan of
dissolution, as well as the asset sale pursuant to the purchase agreement,
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of 3dfx
common stock. Each 3dfx shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share
held, on each matter properly submitted for the vote of shareholders at the
3dfx special meeting. The right to vote is exercisable at the close of business
on the record date, in person or by properly executed proxy.

   The matters to be considered at the 3dfx special meeting are of great
importance to the shareholders of 3dfx. Accordingly, shareholders are urged to
read and carefully consider the information presented in this prospectus/proxy
statement, and to complete, date, sign and promptly return the enclosed proxy
in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

   Pursuant to voting agreements and related irrevocable proxies executed by
all of 3dfx's executive officers and directors, 887,313 outstanding shares of
3dfx common stock (which excludes shares subject to stock options) beneficially
owned by them and their affiliates on     , 2001 (representing approximately
2.2% of the total number of shares of 3dfx common stock outstanding at that
date), will be voted for approval of the dissolution of 3dfx as well as the
asset sale.

Quorum; Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes

   The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of 3dfx common stock entitled to
vote at the 3dfx special meeting shall constitute a quorum. Broker non-votes
and shares held by persons abstaining will be counted in determining whether a
quorum is present at the 3dfx special meeting. Because the affirmative vote of
at least a majority of the outstanding 3dfx common stock is required for the
approval of the proposals presented at the 3dfx special meeting, the failure of
a holder of shares of 3dfx common stock to submit a proxy or to vote in person
at the 3dfx special meeting (including abstentions and "broker non-votes") will
have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the dissolution of 3dfx
and the asset sale.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses of Solicitation

   3dfx will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies in the enclosed form
from its shareholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors,
officers and employees of 3dfx may solicit proxies from shareholders by
telephone, telegram, letter, facsimile, email or in person. Following the
original mailing of the proxies and

                                       39
<PAGE>

other soliciting materials, 3dfx will request that brokers, custodians,
nominees and other record holders forward copies of the proxy and other
soliciting materials to persons for whom they hold shares of 3dfx common stock
and request authority for the exercise of proxies. 3dfx has retained       to
assist in the solicitation of proxies at a cost of approximately     plus
reasonable expenses.

Deadline for Receipt of Shareholder Proposals at Annual Meeting

   Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, a shareholder intending to present a proposal to be included in 3dfx's
proxy statement for its 2001 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, if an annual
meeting is held, must have delivered a proposal in writing to its executive
offices no later than February 6, 2001. If a shareholder does not seek to have
a proposal included in the proxy statement, but nevertheless wishes to present
a proposal or nomination at the annual meeting, written notice of the proposal
or nomination must be received by the secretary of 3dfx at its principal
executive offices not later than the close of business on the 60th day nor
earlier than the close of business on the 90th day before that meeting and must
satisfy other detailed requirements specified in 3dfx's bylaws. However, in the
event that fewer than 65 days prior notice of the 2001 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders is given to shareholders, notice of any shareholder proposals to
be presented at that meeting must be delivered to 3dfx's secretary not later
than the close of business on the seventh day following the day on which the
notice to shareholders was mailed.

                                 THE ASSET SALE

   This section of the prospectus/proxy statement describes material aspects of
the asset sale. While NVIDIA and 3dfx believe that the description covers the
material terms of the asset sale, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should carefully read this entire
prospectus/proxy statement and the other documents referred to in this
prospectus/proxy statement for a more complete understanding of the asset sale.

General Description

   In the asset sale, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NVIDIA, NVIDIA US
Investment Company, has agreed to purchase certain of the assets of 3dfx,
including its core graphics processor assets, pursuant to the purchase
agreement. In return for these assets, NVIDIA US Investment Company has agreed
to pay to 3dfx a total consideration of $70 million in cash at the closing of
the asset sale and, upon the dissolution of 3dfx, to deliver 1,000,000 shares
of NVIDIA common stock.

   The number of shares of NVIDIA stock deliverable to 3dfx will not change
between now and the date that the dissolution of 3dfx is completed, unless,
after the closing of the asset sale and prior to the dissolution of 3dfx, 3dfx
requests that NVIDIA US Investment Company advance to it funds of up to $25
million to be used by 3dfx to pay its or its subsidiaries' creditors. If, upon
satisfaction of various conditions, the advance is provided by NVIDIA US
Investment Company, the number of NVIDIA shares to be delivered to 3dfx will be
reduced by the number of shares equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the amount of the advance by $50. Neither 3dfx nor NVIDIA has the right to
terminate the purchase agreement or renegotiate the number of shares to be
received by 3dfx as a result of market price fluctuations. You are encouraged
to obtain current market quotations of 3dfx and NVIDIA common stock.

   Concurrent with the execution of the purchase agreement, 3dfx, NVIDIA and
NVIDIA US Investment Company entered into other agreements that are related to,
but separate from, the asset sale. Because 3dfx had insufficient cash to
continue operations through the closing of the asset sale, 3dfx and NVIDIA US
Investment Company entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which NVIDIA US
Investment Company provided a $15 million loan to 3dfx, which is repayable out
of the cash consideration that 3dfx will receive upon the closing of the asset
sale, and received in exchange:

  . the assignment and transfer of all of 3dfx's trademarks, tradenames,
    service marks, trademark applications and service mark applications
    pursuant to the trademark assignment; and

  . a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free license for most of 3dfx's
    patents, patent applications and inventions pursuant to the patent
    license agreement.

   In addition, 3dfx and NVIDIA entered into the patent standstill agreement
pursuant to which they both agreed to stay the pending patent lawsuits that
each has filed against the other, and, if the asset sale closed and under other
designated circumstances, to cause the dismissal of these suits with prejudice,
and to refrain from bringing additional litigation against each other with
respect to other patents, patent applications and inventions. See "Other
Related Agreements."

Background

   3dfx develops high performance, cost-effective graphics chips, graphics
boards, software and related technology that enable an interactive and
realistic 3D experience across multiple hardware platforms. In the fall of
2000, 3dfx began experiencing financial difficulties due in part to
substantially reduced demand in the retail channel for its products. This
reduced demand is attributable to a number of factors, including, in part, its
failure to introduce products in a timely manner and from disappointing
customer response to its existing products, as well as reduced demand in the
retail channel in general and the add-in graphics segment in particular. By
September 2000, 3dfx had a negative working capital balance. In addition,
3dfx's high research

                                       41

and development costs and substantial debt burden, together with the loss of
several large customers due to 3dfx's May 1999 acquisition of STB Systems and
its inability to refinance its debt on commercially reasonable terms,
aggravated its financial difficulties. In July 2000, 3dfx began to explore
opportunities to sell its Juarez, Mexico graphics board manufacturing facility
to reduce its fixed costs. In September 2000, the 3dfx board of directors
evaluated 3dfx's business model and concluded that 3dfx could not continue to
operate as a manufacturer of both graphics chips and graphics boards in light
of the losses that 3dfx continued to incur in its graphics board business
segment, and that to maximize shareholder value it would be necessary to
quickly reposition 3dfx to focus principally on the development of graphics
chips and related technologies, and to further analyze the possible termination
or sale of the graphics board business. 3dfx began to explore opportunities to
sell its graphics board assets and transfer the liabilities related to this
business and to obtain an equity investment from a strategic partner to enable
3dfx to implement its revised business strategy. On September 26, 2000, 3dfx
engaged Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin to assist 3dfx in its efforts to sell the
assets and related liabilities of its graphics board manufacturing facility in
Juarez, Mexico, and in November, 2000, 3dfx requested it to explore
opportunities to sell all of its graphics board assets.

   Beginning in September 2000, 3dfx began exploring strategic alternatives for
implementing its revised business model. Between September 2000 and December
2000, 3dfx provided summary information packets and had preliminary discussions
with approximately 17 parties who had expressed an interest in considering a
business transaction with 3dfx or an equity investment in 3dfx. Subsequently,
3dfx entered into confidentiality agreements, provided more detailed
information and had more extensive discussions with several of these parties
relating to a possible transaction.

   During this period, 3dfx also engaged in detailed discussions with a
potential strategic investor with respect to a minority investment in 3dfx to
be evidenced by notes or convertible preferred stock, with a subsequent
investment of an additional amount to be made by the investor upon satisfaction
of specific conditions, including shareholder approval of an increase in 3dfx's
authorized common stock to permit the issuance of additional shares of 3dfx
common stock, significant changes in the composition of 3dfx's management and
board of directors, the disposition of 3dfx's graphics board business and
related liabilities and the achievement of various engineering milestones. 3dfx
and its advisors worked with this potential strategic investor with respect to
the preparation of a non-binding term sheet and draft documentation. The
parties continued to discuss various terms of this transaction through early
December 2000 without reaching final agreement.

   On October 6, 2000, 3dfx requested the assistance of Robertson Stephens to
advise 3dfx in connection with the terms of the foregoing minority investment.
Robertson Stephens had provided financial advisory services to 3dfx in the past
and was familiar with 3dfx's business and operations. In light of 3dfx's
concern regarding the timing of any disposition of its graphics board business
and related liabilities and its conclusion that the proposed strategic
investment would not provide 3dfx with sufficient capital for it to implement
its new business model, on November 16, 2000, 3dfx requested Robertson Stephens
to conduct a search to identify parties interested in either a strategic or
financial transaction with 3dfx.

   Following 3dfx's request, in November and early December 2000, Robertson
Stephens identified and contacted potential interested parties. Members of
3dfx's management also contacted possible interested parties. Of those parties
that were contacted by Robertson Stephens, several signed confidentiality
agreements with 3dfx and were provided confidential financial information in
order to assist them in evaluating a potential transaction with 3dfx. At the
same time, Dr. Alex Leupp, President and Chief Executive Officer of 3dfx, and
Mr. Stephen Lapinski, Senior Vice President of Marketing of 3dfx, as well as
Mr. Scott D. Sellers, 3dfx's Chief Technology Officer, continued to meet with
representatives of the interested strategic investor concerning the terms of
the proposed strategic minority investment in 3dfx in an effort to reach
agreement on the outstanding issues related to that transaction.

   On October 25, 2000, Mr. Phil Carmack, Senior Vice President of Engineering
of 3dfx, and Mr. Sellers met with Mr. Jen-Hsun Huang, Chief Executive Officer
of NVIDIA, and discussed 3dfx's future prospects and

                                       42
<PAGE>

the possibility of mutually beneficial opportunities involving 3dfx and NVIDIA.
Later in October and in November these individuals held further discussions
regarding potential business opportunities involving 3dfx and NVIDIA.

   On November 20, 2000, members of 3dfx management, including Mr. Richard A.
Heddleson, Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Glenn Schuster, Vice President of
Strategic Marketing, met with Ms. Christine B. Hoberg, Chief Financial Officer
of NVIDIA, Mr. Stephen Pettigrew, chief patent counsel at NVIDIA, and Ms. Kelly
Perez, Forecast, Planning and Analysis Manager of NVIDIA, representatives of
Robertson Stephens and representatives of NVIDIA's financial advisor, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, in Santa Clara, California. At the meeting, a
confidentiality agreement was signed and an overview of 3dfx's business was
conducted. Later that day, the 3dfx board of directors met to be updated by
3dfx's management and Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, 3dfx's legal advisors, with
respect to a number of matters under consideration, including the status of
discussions with NVIDIA, the proposed strategic minority investor and other
prospective investors and business combination partners.

   On November 21, 2000, NVIDIA submitted a further request for business
information to Robertson Stephens and conducted further business discussions
regarding 3dfx. NVIDIA then commenced its financial due diligence regarding
3dfx's business. Between November 24 and 26, 2000, the parties engaged in
discussions and a review of 3dfx's financial situation, business and workforce.
During this period, representatives of 3dfx and its legal advisors continued
negotiating with the potential strategic investor with respect to the terms and
amount of the minority investment. Also during this period, management of 3dfx
determined that, based on its anticipated cash flow, its cash would be
exhausted by mid-December 2000, and 3dfx engaged bankruptcy counsel to advise
the company.

   On November 30, 2000, the NVIDIA board of directors met to discuss the
potential transaction.

   The 3dfx board of directors also met on November 30, 2000 with members of
3dfx management and 3dfx's financial and legal advisors to assess the status of
the identification of, and discussions with, parties interested in an
investment or business combination transaction with 3dfx, including NVIDIA and
the proposed strategic minority investor. At this meeting, 3dfx's board of
directors authorized Robertson Stephens to establish a bid deadline in an
auction process. Robertson Stephens then contacted potential interested
parties, including NVIDIA, and requested that interested parties submit bids
for a transaction on or before December 4, 2000. Of those parties contacted by
Robertson Stephens or 3dfx management, only NVIDIA presented an acquisition
proposal.

   On December 1, 2000, members of 3dfx management, including Messrs. Heddleson
and Lapinski, representatives of Robertson Stephens, members of NVIDIA
management, including Mr. Huang and Ms. Hoberg, and representatives of Morgan
Stanley met in San Jose, California. NVIDIA presented a term sheet and the
parties engaged in a discussion of a potential sale of 3dfx assets to NVIDIA.

   On December 2-3, 2000, the 3dfx management team and 3dfx's financial and
legal advisors analyzed the proposed term sheet and prepared a revised term
sheet that was submitted to the 3dfx board of directors for its consideration
at a meeting on December 4, 2000. The 3dfx board of directors authorized the
submission of the revised term sheet to NVIDIA, and during the meeting also
assessed the status of discussions with other parties. Also, during that
meeting, the 3dfx board of directors preliminarily concluded, following lengthy
discussions, that if the proposed asset sale to NVIDIA were to be completed,
the subsequent dissolution of 3dfx was the alternative most likely to protect
3dfx's creditors and maximize the return of value to its shareholders.

   From December 4 through December 8, 2000, the management teams of 3dfx and
NVIDIA and their respective financial and legal advisors negotiated the terms
of the proposed transaction and reached a tentative understanding as to the
terms of the asset sale on December 8, 2000. 3dfx's management then distributed
a package of information concerning the proposed transaction with NVIDIA
together with the latest draft of the term sheet with the potential strategic
investor to the 3dfx board of directors for review and consideration.

                                       43
<PAGE>

   Following receipt of this information, on Saturday, December 9, 2000, the
board of directors of 3dfx and 3dfx's financial and legal advisors held a
meeting to formally discuss the terms of the proposed asset sale and the
strategic minority investment proposal and their respective merits. After a
lengthy discussion of each proposed transaction, the 3dfx board of directors
preliminarily concluded that the proposed transaction with the potential
strategic minority investor appeared to be in the best interests of 3dfx, its
creditors and its shareholders. The 3dfx board of directors' determination was
based on the respective consideration offered by the parties and a comparison
of the conditions to closing of the two proposals. The 3dfx board determined
that several closing conditions in NVIDIA's first proposal made it unlikely
that the transaction would close without a significant reduction in the
consideration. Upon communication of this conclusion to NVIDIA, NVIDIA
requested an opportunity to submit a revised proposal relating to the asset
sale by Sunday, December 10, 2000, and the board of directors of 3dfx agreed to
this request.

   Following discussions among Mr. Heddleson, Mr. Huang and Ms. Hoberg during
the evening of Saturday, December 9, 2000, and the morning of Sunday, December
10, 2000, as well as discussions between Mr. Sellers and Mr. Huang on December
10, 2000, NVIDIA submitted a revised proposal with respect to the asset sale on
December 10, 2000.

   Later on Sunday, December 10, 2000, the 3dfx board of directors held a
meeting with its legal advisors present to discuss the revised proposal
submitted by NVIDIA. After extensive discussions concerning the revised NVIDIA
proposal as compared to the strategic minority investment proposal, as well as
3dfx's financial situation and prospects, and the absence of other proposals
notwithstanding the efforts of 3dfx's management and financial advisors, the
3dfx board of directors concluded that the revised proposal submitted by NVIDIA
for the asset sale, to be closed in connection with the implementation of a
plan of dissolution, was the proposal most likely to permit 3dfx to pay debts
owed to its and its subsidiaries' creditors and to permit 3dfx shareholders to
realize value for their investment in 3dfx. In reaching this conclusion, the
3dfx board of directors particularly noted that the size of the investment
proposed by the strategic investor was, at its maximum amount and assuming all
funding conditions were met, less than half of the amount of financing that
3dfx management believed to be necessary to repay its outstanding debts and
implement its new business plan. Moreover, the availability of additional
financing was substantially in doubt, and there was a strong likelihood that
the pursuit of the strategic investment could result in 3dfx not being able to
pay its creditors or provide any return to its shareholders. Upon Mr.
Lapinski's communication of the board's determination to the proposed minority
investor, the party elected not to continue negotiations or to submit a new
proposal. The 3dfx directors then present at the meeting unanimously authorized
the preparation of definitive documentation for the proposed asset sale and
dissolution of 3dfx and directed 3dfx's officers and legal and financial
advisors to proceed with the preparation of definitive transaction documents.

   During the evening of December 11, 2000, Cooley Godward llp, legal advisors
to NVIDIA, delivered the initial draft of the purchase agreement to 3dfx and
its legal and financial advisors.

   During the week of December 11 through December 15, 2000, discussions and
negotiations proceeded between the senior management and financial and legal
advisors of 3dfx and NVIDIA regarding the terms of the proposed asset sale and
related transactions. At the same time, the parties conducted financial and
legal due diligence. As Robertson Stephens had advised 3dfx that its position
as a creditor for past services rendered to 3dfx presented a possible conflict
of interest, 3dfx engaged Needham & Company, Inc. to advise 3dfx as to the
fairness of the transaction to 3dfx, from a financial point of view. At the
conclusion of these discussions and negotiations, on December 14, 2000, the
parties reached an agreement on the key terms of the transaction. Later that
evening, NVIDIA convened a telephonic meeting of its board of directors. The
board of directors of NVIDIA approved the proposed asset sale and related
transactions to which it is a party, subject to there not being any material
changes in the terms outlined during their meeting. The board of directors of
NVIDIA US Investment Company also approved the asset sale and related
transactions to which it is a party by unanimous written consent.

   On the morning of December 15, 2000, the board of directors and senior
management of 3dfx held a meeting at which 3dfx senior management reported that
an agreement had been reached with respect to the key

                                       44
<PAGE>

terms of the proposed asset sale and related transactions. The 3dfx board of
directors discussed with 3dfx's management and its legal and financial advisors
the structure of the asset sale and related transactions. In addition, the
senior management and financial and legal advisors to 3dfx reported to the 3dfx
board of directors the results of the due diligence investigation of NVIDIA and
the potential benefits and risks to 3dfx's creditors and shareholders of the
proposed transaction, and responded to questions from members of the 3dfx board
of directors. Locke Liddell & Sapp presented to the 3dfx board of directors a
detailed description of the proposed terms of the asset sale and related
transactions, together with a legal analysis of other issues for the board's
consideration. Needham discussed with the 3dfx board of directors various
analyses relating to the asset sale and related transactions and responded to
questions regarding such analyses. At the conclusion of these presentations,
Needham delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as
of that date, the consideration to be received by 3dfx in the asset sale was
fair to 3dfx from a financial point of view. The board of directors discussed
the asset sale in light of its decision to approve the implementation of a plan
of dissolution, a description of which is set forth under the caption "The
Dissolution of 3dfx--Reasons for the Dissolution of 3dfx."

   During the discussions and presentations outlined above, and prior to
submitting any matter to a vote, Messrs. George Haber and Andrei Manoliu
submitted their resignations as members of 3dfx's board of directors to be
effective immediately, which resignations were accepted by the 3dfx board of
directors. After further discussion, the remaining 3dfx directors unanimously
approved both the asset sale and related transactions and the dissolution of
3dfx, subject to satisfaction of 3dfx's management and legal advisors with the
form and substance of the definitive transaction documents, and the remaining
directors of 3dfx executed a written consent unanimously approving the asset
sale and related transactions and the dissolution of 3dfx and directing
submission, with the recommendations of the board of directors for their
approval, of the matters to the shareholders of 3dfx for their approval.

   During the afternoon of December 15, 2000, the parties finalized the
transaction agreements. The purchase agreement and the documents for the
related transactions were executed by NVIDIA, NVIDIA US Investment Company and
3dfx, and public announcement of the proposed transactions was made.

Reasons for the Asset Sale

   The following discussion of the reasons for the asset sale contains a number
of forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of NVIDIA or 3dfx
with respect to future events that may have an effect on their financial
performance. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes
discussed in the forward-looking statements. Cautionary statements that
identify important factors that could cause or contribute to differences in
results and outcomes include those discussed in "Forward-Looking Information"
and "Risk Factors."

NVIDIA's and NVIDIA US Investment Company's Reasons for Entering Into the Asset
Sale

   On December 14, 2000, NVIDIA's and NVIDIA US Investment Company's boards of
directors determined that the terms of the purchase agreement are fair to, and
in the best interests of, NVIDIA, NVIDIA US Investment Company and NVIDIA's
stockholders.

   NVIDIA's and NVIDIA US Investment Company's boards of directors consulted
with NVIDIA's senior management, as well as NVIDIA's financial advisors and
legal counsel, in reaching their decisions to approve the purchase agreement.
NVIDIA's and NVIDIA US Investment Company's primary reasons for entering into
the purchase agreement with 3dfx are the beliefs of their respective boards of
directors and the management of NVIDIA that the purchase agreement could result
in a number of benefits, including their belief that it may allow them to:

  . accelerate innovation and time-to-market and thereby better meet customer
    needs for next-generation graphics processors;

  . accelerate expansion into existing and new market segments for graphics
    processors;

                                       45
<PAGE>

  . be more competitive with other leading graphics processor companies,
    including, but not limited to, Intel Corporation, ATI Technologies Inc.,
    3Dlabs, Inc. Ltd., Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated
    Systems Corp., and VIA Technologies, Inc.;

  . add to their intellectual property portfolio in the field of graphics
    processors;

  . stay, and dismiss with prejudice upon closing of the asset purchase or
    under other designated circumstances, the pending patent lawsuits between
    NVIDIA and 3dfx; and

  . have the opportunity to add qualified engineers and other technical
    employees from the former 3dfx workforce to NVIDIA US Investment Company
    and thereby enhance its expertise in graphics processor technology.

   In reaching the determination that the purchase agreement is in the best
interests of NVIDIA, NVIDIA US Investment Company and NVIDIA's stockholders,
the respective boards of directors of NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company
considered a number of factors, including the factors discussed above and
listed below. The conclusions reached by the boards of directors of NVIDIA and
NVIDIA US Investment Company with respect to these factors supported the
determination that the purchase by NVIDIA US Investment Company of certain of
3dfx's assets, including 3dfx's core graphics processor assets, and the
issuance of shares of NVIDIA common stock in the purchase agreement, was fair
to, and in the best interests of, NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company:

  . the judgment, advice and analyses of NVIDIA's management with respect to
    the potential strategic, financial and operational benefits of the
    purchase, including NVIDIA management's favorable recommendation of the
    purchase agreement;

  . the terms of the purchase agreement, including price and structure, which
    were considered by both boards of directors and by the management of
    NVIDIA to provide a fair and equitable basis for the overall transaction;

  . the cash position and balance sheet liquidity of NVIDIA following
    completion of the transaction, especially during periods of volatility in
    the financial markets; and

  . the cash position and balance sheet liquidity of 3dfx following
    completion of the transaction, especially taking into consideration
    3dfx's winding up of its business.

   The boards of directors of NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company also
considered a number of potentially negative factors in their respective
deliberations concerning the overall transaction. The potentially negative
factors considered by the boards of directors of NVIDIA and NVIDIA US
Investment Company included:

  . the risk that the transaction might not be completed in a timely manner
    or at all;

  . the potential negative impact of any vendor or partner confusion after
    announcement of the proposed transaction;

  . the potential negative reaction of the financial community after
    announcement of the proposed transaction;

  . the risk that the potential benefits of the transaction may not be
    realized, including the inability of NVIDIA US Investment Company to hire
    the former technical and engineering employees of 3dfx;

  . the risk of insolvency of 3dfx;

  . the costs associated with the transaction, including transaction-related
    costs and costs associated with renegotiating or terminating marketing
    agreements; and

  . the other risks and uncertainties discussed above under "Risk Factors."

                                       46
<PAGE>

   The foregoing discussion of information and factors considered by NVIDIA's
and NVIDIA US Investment Company's boards of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but is believed to include all material factors considered by the
boards. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by NVIDIA's and
NVIDIA US Investment Company's boards of directors, NVIDIA's and NVIDIA US
Investment Company's boards of directors did not find it practicable to
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered. In addition, the boards did not reach any specific conclusions on
each factor considered, or any aspect of any particular factor, but conducted
an overall analysis of these factors. Individual members of NVIDIA's and NVIDIA
US Investment Company's boards of directors may have given different weights to
different factors. After taking into account all of the factors set forth
above, however, NVIDIA's and NVIDIA US Investment Company's boards of directors
agreed that the purchase agreement was fair to, and in the best interests of,
NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company and their respective shareholders and
that NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company should proceed with the purchase
and to enter into the purchase agreement.

   There can be no assurance that the benefits of the potential growth,
synergies or opportunities considered by the boards will be achieved through
completion of the purchase. See "Risk Factors."

3dfx's Reasons for the Asset Sale and Recommendation of 3dfx Board of Directors

   3dfx's board of directors has unanimously determined that the asset sale and
the purchase agreement are fair to and in the best interests of 3dfx and its
creditors and shareholders, and has unanimously approved the purchase agreement
and the asset sale. Accordingly, 3dfx's board of directors unanimously
recommends that its shareholders vote "FOR" the asset sale.

   In reaching its determination, the 3dfx board of directors considered a
number of factors, including, without limitation, the following:

  . the present and anticipated environment of the graphics chip and board
    industries, particularly in the retail markets where 3dfx concentrates
    its efforts. The graphics board add-in business has diminished
    substantially as a result of the increased integration of the graphics
    boards directly into the PCs by the manufacturers prior to delivery into
    the retail channel. Further, to date the efforts of 3dfx to dispose of
    its graphics board business assets and related liabilities had been
    unsuccessful;

  . the conclusion of the 3dfx board of directors that 3dfx would not be able
    to operate effectively in light of the significant losses that it was
    incurring and expected to continue to incur under its present business
    model, nor would it be able to raise the capital necessary in a timely
    manner to permit it to implement its new business model to reposition
    itself as a graphics chip company and to dispose of its graphics board
    business assets and liabilities in light of 3dfx's increasingly
    precarious cash flow position and mounting liabilities;

  . the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement, including the amount
    and form of consideration to be extended in the form of a $15 million
    loan immediately upon execution of the purchase agreement, the amount of
    cash and shares of NVIDIA common stock to be received on or after
    closing, and of the financial ability of NVIDIA to provide funding for
    the asset sale so that the asset sale is not conditioned on financing,
    all of which led the 3dfx directors to conclude that it was reasonably
    likely that the asset sale would be completed and that as a result 3dfx
    would be most likely to be able to satisfy the liabilities owed to its
    and its subsidiaries' creditors and be in a position to maximize the
    return of value to its shareholders;

  . the efforts made by Robertson Stephens and 3dfx management to contact and
    determine the level of interest of third parties in a business
    combination or financial transaction; and

  . the financial presentation of Needham & Company, Inc. to the 3dfx board
    of directors, including Needham & Company, Inc.'s written opinion dated
    December 15, 2000, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and
    based upon and subject to the matters stated in the opinion, the
    consideration to be received by 3dfx in the asset sale was fair, from a
    financial point of view, to 3dfx.

                                       47
<PAGE>

   The 3dfx board of directors also considered a number of potentially negative
factors in its deliberations concerning the overall transaction. The
potentially negative factors considered by the 3dfx board included:

  . the risk that the transaction might not be completed in a timely manner
    or at all;

  . the fact that 3dfx could lose other transaction opportunities during the
    period it is precluded under the terms of the purchase agreement from
    soliciting other transaction proposals;

  . the fact that even if the asset sale did not close, 3dfx would have
    already assigned to NVIDIA US Investment Company all of its trademarks,
    tradenames, services and related applications, and under some
    circumstances, the patent license granted to NVIDIA US Investment Company
    would continue in effect and the pending patent lawsuits between 3dfx and
    NVIDIA would be dismissed with prejudice;

  . the potential negative impact of any vendor or creditor confusion after
    announcement of the proposed transaction;

  . the fact that 3dfx would not be able to continue as an independent going
    concern in its present form;

  . the potential negative reaction of the financial community after
    announcement of the proposed transaction; and

  . the other risks and uncertainties discussed above under "Risk Factors."

   The foregoing discussion of the information and the factors considered by
the 3dfx board of directors is not meant to be exhaustive, but includes the
material factors considered by the 3dfx board of directors. The board of
directors of 3dfx did not quantify or attach any particular weight to the
various factors that they considered in reaching their determination that the
purchase agreement and the asset sale are fair to and in the best interests of
3dfx, its creditors and shareholders. Rather, the 3dfx board of directors
viewed its recommendation as being based upon its business judgment in light of
3dfx's financial position and the totality of the information presented and
considered, and the overall effect of the asset sale and the dissolution of
3dfx described below on the creditors and shareholders of 3dfx compared to
continuing the business of 3dfx or seeking other potential parties to effect an
investment in or other business combination with 3dfx.

   There can be no assurance that the benefits of the asset sale will be
realized by 3dfx's shareholders. See "Risk Factors."

Vote Required for the Asset Sale

   The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of 3dfx common stock is required to approve its sale of certain of 3dfx's
assets pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. Pursuant to voting
agreements and related irrevocable proxies executed by all of 3dfx's executive
officers and directors, 887,313 outstanding shares of 3dfx common stock (which
excludes shares subject to stock options) beneficially owned by them and their
affiliates on      , 2001 (representing approximately 2.2% of the total number
of shares of 3dfx common stock outstanding at that date), will be voted for
approval of the asset sale.

Opinion of 3dfx's Financial Advisor

   3dfx retained Needham & Company, Inc. to render an opinion as to the
fairness to 3dfx, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be
received by 3dfx in the asset sale. The amount of consideration to be paid in
the asset sale was determined through arm's length negotiations between 3dfx
and NVIDIA and not by Needham.

   At a meeting of the 3dfx board of directors on December 15, 2000, Needham
delivered its oral opinion, which it subsequently confirmed in writing, that,
as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions and other matters
described in the written Needham opinion, the proposed consideration is fair to
3dfx from a

                                       48
<PAGE>

financial point of view. The Needham opinion is addressed to the 3dfx board of
directors, is directed only to the financial terms of the purchase agreement,
and does not constitute a recommendation to any 3dfx shareholder as to how that
shareholder should vote at the 3dfx special meeting.

   The complete text of the Needham opinion, which sets forth the assumptions
made, matters considered, limitations on and scope of the review undertaken by
Needham, is attached to this document as Annex C, and the summary of the
Needham opinion set forth in this document is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Needham opinion. 3dfx shareholders are urged to read the
Needham opinion carefully and in its entirety for a description of the
procedures followed, the factors considered, and the assumptions made by
Needham.

   In arriving at its opinion, Needham, among other things:

  . reviewed a draft of the purchase agreement dated December 15, 2000;

  . reviewed selected publicly available information concerning 3dfx and
    selected other relevant financial and operating data of 3dfx furnished to
    it by 3dfx, including management's draft financial statements as of and
    for the quarter ended October 31, 2000;

  . held discussions with members of 3dfx's management concerning 3dfx's
    current and future business prospects;

  . reviewed and discussed with 3dfx's management various financial forecasts
    and projections prepared by management;

  . reviewed the historical stock prices and trading volumes of 3dfx common
    stock and NVIDIA common stock;

  . compared publicly available financial data of companies whose securities
    are traded in the public markets and that Needham deemed generally
    relevant to similar data for 3dfx and NVIDIA;

  . reviewed the financial terms of selected other business combinations that
    Needham deemed generally relevant; and

  . performed and/or considered such other studies, analyses, inquiries and
    investigations as Needham deemed appropriate.

   In addition, Needham held discussions with members of 3dfx's management and
its representatives concerning 3dfx's views as to:

  . the anticipated adverse effects on 3dfx's business, assets, liabilities,
    operations and prospects that 3dfx believes would occur if 3dfx were not
    to enter into the purchase agreement and the credit agreement;

  . 3dfx's liquidity position and its ability to continue as a going concern;

  . 3dfx's anticipated inability to remedy its liquidity shortfall and the
    substantial risk of 3dfx becoming insolvent and seeking the protection of
    state insolvency or federal bankruptcy law;

  . the anticipated substantial adverse effects on 3dfx's shareholders and
    present and potential employees, business partners and lenders that would
    result from insolvency or concerns about the potential for it; and

  . the anticipated benefits that would arise from entering into the purchase
    agreement and credit agreement, including the substantial lessening of
    those liquidity and solvency concerns.

   Needham also held discussions with Robertson Stephens as to its efforts to
solicit third party indications of interest for the acquisition of 3dfx or all
or some of its assets and for financing of 3dfx. Needham was not authorized by
3dfx or its board of directors to solicit, and did not solicit, any such
indications of interest.

   Needham assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by or discussed with it
for purposes of rendering its opinion. Needham assumed that the

                                       49
<PAGE>

financial forecasts provided to Needham by 3dfx's management were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of management, at the time of preparation, of 3dfx's future operating
and financial performance. Needham also assumed that the cash consideration to
be paid pursuant to the purchase agreement will be sufficient to pay all of
3dfx's liabilities, including taxes due and other amounts owed as a result of
the asset sale. Needham did not assume any responsibility for or make or obtain
any independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the assets or
liabilities of 3dfx. The Needham opinion states that it was based on economic,
monetary and market conditions existing as of its date. Needham expressed no
opinion as to the prices at which the 3dfx common stock or NVIDIA common stock
will trade at any time. In addition, Needham was not asked to consider, and the
Needham opinion did not address:

  . 3dfx's underlying business decision to engage in the asset sale or
    dissolution,

  . the consideration to be received by any individual shareholder in the
    dissolution,

  . the relative merits of the asset sale and dissolution as compared to any
    alternative business strategies that might exist for 3dfx, or

  . the effect of any other transaction in which 3dfx might engage.

   Needham expressed no opinion on 3dfx's solvency and expressed no opinion on
3dfx's ability to continue as a going concern should the asset sale and
dissolution not be completed.

   No limitations were imposed by 3dfx on Needham with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed by Needham in rendering its opinion.

   Based on this information, Needham performed a variety of financial analyses
of the asset sale and the consideration to be received by 3dfx in the asset
sale. The following paragraphs summarize the material financial analyses
performed by Needham in arriving at its opinion.

   Needham's analyses were based upon the closing price per share of NVIDIA
common stock of $41.56 on December 14, 2000 and assumed two scenarios based
upon 3dfx management's estimates as to potential liabilities at the closing of
the asset sale:

  . an "upside" liquidation scenario in which 3dfx would have a cash
    deficiency of $5.27 million at closing, which would result in 894,600
    shares of NVIDIA common stock being issued to 3dfx, after deduction of
    the amount required to offset the extra cash paid by NVIDIA in accordance
    with the terms of the purchase agreement, and

  . a "downside" liquidation scenario in which 3dfx would have a cash
    deficiency of $25.17 million at closing, which would result in 500,000
    shares of NVIDIA common stock being issued to 3dfx, after deduction of
    the amount required to offset the extra cash paid by NVIDIA in accordance
    with the terms of the purchase agreement.

   While the two scenarios represent 3dfx management's reasonable estimates, at
the time they were made, of the potential amounts required to satisfy the debts
and liabilities of 3dfx following the asset sale, actual amounts could vary
significantly. The actual amounts required to satisfy 3dfx's debts and
liabilities upon liquidation of 3dfx could be greater than those estimated in
the downside scenario.

   Going Concern/Liquidation Analysis. Based on 3dfx management's estimates,
Needham prepared a going concern analysis comparing the results to the upside
and downside liquidation scenarios described above. The going concern analysis
assumed that following the closing of the NVIDIA transaction, 3dfx would
continue as a board company and would, among other things, invest $5.75 million
to $7.5 million per month in chips and materials for manufacturing of boards,
with first boards being available for sale in May 2001 and cash collection from
initial board sales beginning in June 2001. This analysis showed that 3dfx's
cash deficiency and liquidity problems would increase significantly as compared
with the scenario in which 3dfx would reduce expenses as rapidly as possible
following the closing of the NVIDIA transaction and seek to

                                       50
<PAGE>

generate additional cash from the sale of remaining assets in anticipation of
the dissolution of 3dfx and providing for payment in full of all remaining
liabilities.

   Needham reviewed 3dfx's historical financial results, including management's
draft financial statements as of and for the quarter ended October 31, 2000,
and noted that 3dfx's current and quick ratios deteriorated significantly and
were both less than 1.0 as of October 31, 2000. The current ratio is the ratio
of current assets to current liabilities, and the quick ratio is the ratio of
current assets, net of inventories, to current liabilities. These ratios are
indicators of a company's liquidity and ability to meet its debts as they
become due. Needham noted that 3dfx's financial advisors had informed 3dfx that
they were unable to obtain any indications of interest for alternative
acquisition transactions other than from NVIDIA and had received indications
for financing transactions only with respect to minority investments that were
substantially less than the amount 3dfx's management had determined would
permit 3dfx to satisfy the claims of its creditors and implement its revised
business model. Needham further noted management's assessment that this
inability to raise sufficient financing, coupled with 3dfx's liquidity
position, raised substantial doubts as to 3dfx's ability to continue as a going
concern.

   Value Sensitivity Analysis. Because a significant portion of the
consideration for the asset sale is shares of NVIDIA common stock, Needham
analyzed the effects of changes in the value of NVIDIA common stock on the
potential per share amounts available to 3dfx shareholders upon dissolution.
Needham's analysis used the upside and downside dissolution scenarios described
above, and assumed that all amounts in excess of management's estimates of 3dfx
liabilities would be available for distribution to 3dfx shareholders upon
dissolution of 3dfx. The analysis considered various stock prices for NVIDIA
common stock ranging from $20.00 per share to $80.00 per share. The analysis
showed that the potential amount distributable per 3dfx per share ranged from
$0.25 to $0.99 in the downside scenario, and from $0.44 to $1.78 in the upside
scenario. This analysis was based on a number of specific assumptions as to,
among other things, the amount of liabilities of 3dfx upon closing of the asset
sale and to be incurred prior to dissolution of 3dfx, and the actual amount of
assets available to 3dfx shareholders in liquidation. These factors are subject
to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and
contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of 3dfx. Accordingly, this
analysis should not be relied upon by 3dfx shareholders as being indicative of
amounts they will receive upon liquidation and dissolution of 3dfx.

   Selected Company Analysis. Using publicly available information, Needham
compared selected historical and projected financial and market data ratios for
3dfx to the corresponding data and ratios of other publicly traded fabless
semiconductor graphics companies that Needham deemed relevant because their
lines of businesses are similar to 3dfx's line of business. These companies,
referred to as the selected companies, consisted of:

       ATI Technologies, Inc.        NeoMagic Corporation
       3dlabs Inc., Ltd.             Trident Microsystems, Inc.

   The following table sets forth information, for the selected companies,
NVIDIA and 3dfx, concerning multiples of total market capitalization to last
twelve months' revenues. Needham calculated multiples for the selected
companies and NVIDIA based on the closing stock prices on December 14, 2000 and
for 3dfx based on the two scenarios described above. The table also sets forth
comparative information regarding gross margins based on last twelve months'
revenues for the selected companies, NVIDIA and 3dfx. Needham also noted that
of those companies, only NVIDIA had positive operating margins based on last
twelve months' revenues.

   Needham calculated the market value of common stock as a multiple of
earnings per share, or price/earnings multiple, for the last twelve months and
projected calendar 2000 and 2001, and market capitalization to projected 2001
revenues, but determined that the results were not meaningful because of 3dfx's
historical and projected net losses and absence of forecast revenues for
calendar 2001 due to 3dfx's severe liquidity shortfall.

   Selected Transaction Analysis. Needham also analyzed publicly available
financial information for selected mergers and acquisitions involving graphics
chip companies since January 1, 1997. Of the seven transactions reviewed, only
three had meaningful available financial information:

      3dfx Interactive, Inc.  STB Systems, Inc.
      VIA Technologies, Inc.  S3 Incorporated (graphics business)
</TABLE>

In examining these transactions, referred to as the selected transactions,
Needham analyzed

  . the premium of consideration offered to the acquired company's stock
    price one day prior to the announcement of the transaction;

  . the premium of consideration offered to the acquired company's stock
    price four weeks prior to the announcement of the transaction;

  . the aggregate transaction value as a multiple of the acquired company's
    sales for the last twelve months' sales; and

  . market value as a multiple of the acquired company's historical book
    value.

   Needham also analyzed, for the selected transactions,

  . the aggregate transaction value as a multiple of the acquired company's
    earnings before interest and taxes for the last twelve months;

  . the aggregate transaction value as a multiple of the acquired company's
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the
    last twelve months; and

  . market value as a multiple of the acquired company's net income for the
    last twelve months.

but determined that the results were not meaningful because of 3dfx's net
losses.

   The following table sets forth information concerning the stock price
premiums in the selected transactions and the stock price premiums implied by
the asset sale in the upside and downside scenarios.

   Needham placed relatively less emphasis on the "Selected Company Analysis"
and "Selected Transaction Analysis" due to 3dfx's severe liquidity constraints
and lack of alternatives. No company, transaction or business used in the
"Selected Company Analysis" or "Selected Transaction Analysis" as a comparison
is identical to 3dfx, NVIDIA or the asset sale. Accordingly, these analyses are
not simply mathematical; rather, they involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in the financial and operating characteristics
and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other
values of the selected companies, selected transactions, or the business
segment, company or transaction to which they are being compared.

   Other Analyses. In rendering its opinion, Needham considered various other
analyses, including, among other things, a history of trading prices and
volumes for NVIDIA and 3dfx, noting that, in general, NVIDIA common stock
outperformed the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indices over the one-year period
ended December 14, 2000 while 3dfx common stock under-performed those indices.

   The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses performed by Needham in connection with the rendering of its
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations
as to the most appropriate and relevant quantitative and qualitative methods of
financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to
summary description. Accordingly, Needham believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that considering any portion of its analyses or the
factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create
a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In its
analyses, Needham made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of 3dfx or NVIDIA. Any estimates contained in these analyses
are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results
or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable. Additionally,
analyses relating to the values of business or assets do not purport to be
appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or assets may
actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently
subject to substantial uncertainty. The Needham opinion and Needham's related
analyses were only one of many factors considered by 3dfx's board of directors
in its evaluation of the asset sale and should not be viewed as determinative
of the views of 3dfx's board of directors or management with respect to the
asset sale or the consideration to be received by 3dfx in the asset sale.

   Under the terms of Needham's engagement letter with 3dfx, 3dfx has paid
Needham fees for rendering the Needham opinion that 3dfx and Needham believe
are customary in transactions of this nature. None of Needham's fees are
contingent on completion of the asset sale or dissolution. 3dfx has also agreed
to reimburse Needham for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify
it against specified liabilities relating to or arising out of the rendering of
the opinion or other services performed under the engagement letter by Needham
as financial advisor to 3dfx.

   Needham is a nationally recognized investment banking firm. As part of its
investment banking services, Needham is frequently engaged in the evaluation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of securities, private
placements and other purposes. Needham was retained by the 3dfx board of
directors to act as a financial advisor in connection with the asset sale based
on Needham's experience as a financial advisor in mergers and acquisitions as
well as Needham's familiarity with the semiconductor industry. Needham has had
no other investment banking relationship with 3dfx during the past two years.
In the normal course of its business, Needham may actively trade the equity
securities of 3dfx or NVIDIA for its own account or for the account of its
customers and, therefore, may at any time hold a long or short position in
those securities.

Interests of Some 3dfx Officers in the Asset Sale

   Several executive officers of 3dfx have personal interests in the asset sale
that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of most 3dfx
shareholders. As a result, these executive officers may have conflicts of
interest that influenced their support of the asset sale.

                                       53
<PAGE>

   3dfx is a party to employment agreements with the following 3dfx senior
executive officers: Alex Leupp, Scott Sellers, Stephen Lapinski, Richard Burns
and Al Woodhull. These employment agreements were recently amended. Prior to
their amendment, these agreements provided for limited severance and other
benefits (continued payment of base pay for up to one year and reimbursement of
COBRA premiums for group medical coverage) if 3dfx terminated the executive's
employment without cause, and before the occurrence of a change of control.
Following a change of control, which was defined to include the closing of
certain types of transactions that would include the asset sale, the agreements
provided for a lump sum severance payment equal to one times the executive's
base salary (1.25x in the case of 3dfx's chief executive officer, Dr. Leupp)
plus one times the executive's targeted bonus for the year (1.25x in the case
of Dr. Leupp).

   Upon the announcement of the proposed asset sale and dissolution of 3dfx,
3dfx laid off a substantial portion of its workforce in order to conserve its
resources. In order to assure the dedication and continued efforts of 3dfx's
executives through the critical transition period up to the closing of the
asset sale, the independent members of the 3dfx board of directors and 3dfx's
executives negotiated amendments to the employment agreements. The purpose of
the amendments was twofold: first, to create an incentive for each executive to
continue his employment until the closing of the asset sale, and during this
period to devote substantially all of his efforts to the enhancement of
shareholder value; and second, to conserve resources by reducing the amount of
the severance benefit to which the executive would be entitled if he continued
in the employment of 3dfx through the closing of the asset sale. The amended
agreements are effective as of February 1, 2001.

   For all executives except Mr. Burns, the amended agreements provide, in lieu
of the prior severance arrangements, that lump sum severance and COBRA premium
reimbursement benefits will be paid to the executive if (i) the closing of the
asset sale occurs within 12 months following the amendment, and (ii) the
executive remains employed through the closing of the asset sale. The amount of
the lump sum severance benefit is equal to one times (1.25x in the case of Dr.
Leupp) the sum of the executive's base salary and 50% of his targeted bonus,
reduced by the base salary paid to the executive during the period from
February 1 through the closing date of the asset sale. The lump sum severance
benefit is not payable to the executives until after 3dfx's payment of all of
its fixed and ascertainable debts and liabilities. The amended agreements also
specify the board of directors' expectations for each executive to devote his
efforts to collection of outstanding receivables, negotiation of favorable
terms for the settlement of 3dfx liabilities, increasing cash recovered in the
sale of remaining inventories, and other specific duties.

   In the case of Mr. Burns, the amended agreement provides, in lieu of the
prior severance arrangement, that he will receive a lump sum severance benefit
equal to one times his base salary upon termination of his employment. His
employment duties are limited to collecting or resolving certain outstanding
retail accounts receivable for which he is principally responsible. Upon
substantial completion of these duties (expected to occur on or before February
28, 2001), his employment will terminate.

   The independent members of the 3dfx board of directors determined that the
amended agreements are in the best interests of 3dfx because of the enhanced
shareholder value achievable through the targeted efforts of its executives.
The amended agreements create an incentive on the part of 3dfx's executives to
work toward achieving increased cash liquidity for 3dfx's creditors and
shareholders, while also reducing the severance obligation triggered by the
closing of the asset sale.

Governmental Approvals

   Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the asset sale may
not be completed until notifications have been given and certain information
has been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department
of Justice and specified waiting period requirements have been satisfied or
early termination of the waiting period is granted at the request of NVIDIA and
3dfx. NVIDIA and 3dfx filed notification and report forms under the HSR Act
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division on January 10, 2001, and requested
early termination of the applicable waiting period. These filings commenced a
30-day waiting

                                       54
<PAGE>

period under the HSR Act. If, prior to the expiration of this period, the FTC
or the Antitrust Division should request additional information or documentary
material under the HSR Act, completion of the asset sale and, as a result, the
disposition of 3dfx's remaining assets pursuant to the plan of dissolution
could be delayed until after the companies have substantially complied with the
request.

   There can be no assurance that a challenge to the asset sale on antitrust
grounds will not be made, or if such challenge is made, that NVIDIA and 3dfx
would prevail or would not be required to terminate the purchase agreement, to
divest certain assets, to license certain proprietary technology to third
parties or to accept certain conditions in order to complete the asset sale.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences Relating to the Asset Sale

   3dfx has determined that even though the asset sale contemplates that a
portion of the consideration to be received by 3dfx could consist of NVIDIA
common stock, the asset sale will not constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. 3dfx will recognize gain
as a result of the asset sale equal to the excess of the amount realized by
3dfx over its basis in the assets sold pursuant to the asset sale. The amount
realized by 3dfx will include the cash consideration and the fair market value
of the consideration consisting of NVIDIA common stock. 3dfx expects that it
will have significant operating losses and losses attributable to the
liquidation for the year of the asset sale which will offset a portion of the
asset sale gain. In addition, 3dfx has significant net operating losses that it
may utilize to offset a portion of its gain attributable to the asset sale.
While 3dfx cannot determine at this time its tax liability for the year of the
asset sale, 3dfx expects that it will incur some alternative minimum tax
liability for such year. See also "Dissolution of 3dfx--Material Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Liquidation and Dissolution."

Anticipated Accounting Treatment

   For purposes of financial reporting, NVIDIA expects to account for the
transaction as a "purchase."

Absence of Dissenters' Rights Related to the Asset Sale

   California law does not provide dissenters' rights with respect to the asset
sale.

                            THE DISSOLUTION OF 3DFX

   This section of the prospectus/proxy statement describes material aspects
and implications of the dissolution of 3dfx. While 3dfx believes that the
description covers the material aspects of the dissolution of 3dfx, this
summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You
should carefully read this entire prospectus/proxy statement and the other
documents referred to in this prospectus/proxy statement for a more complete
understanding of the proposed dissolution of 3dfx.

General Description

   The 3dfx board of directors has approved the dissolution of 3dfx as
described in the plan of dissolution attached to this prospectus/proxy
statement as Annex A. If the plan of dissolution is approved by the
shareholders, the board of directors, without further action by the
shareholders (except those actions as may be required by law or as the 3dfx
board of directors may deem appropriate), may elect at any time to dissolve
3dfx after payment of, or provision for the payment of, all debts and
liabilities of 3dfx and its subsidiaries. Any remaining assets would be
distributed to 3dfx shareholders. Approval by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock is required to approve the liquidation,
winding up and dissolution of 3dfx pursuant to the plan of dissolution. In the
event that the shareholders of 3dfx fail to approve both the asset sale and the
dissolution, NVIDIA and 3dfx would each have the option to terminate the
purchase agreement.

Reasons for the Dissolution of 3dfx

   The following discussion of the reasons for the dissolution of 3dfx contains
a number of forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of 3dfx
with respect to future events. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks
and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the
results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. Cautionary
statements that identify important factors that could cause or contribute to
differences in results and outcomes include those discussed in "Forward-Looking
Information" and "Risk Factors."

   Beginning in mid-November 2000, 3dfx, with the assistance of its financial
advisor Robertson Stephens, undertook a review of 3dfx's strategic
alternatives, including obtaining new sources of financing and consideration of
a merger, reorganization or sale of some or all of the assets of 3dfx, and
Robertson Stephens contacted both strategic and financial parties to determine
their interest in such transactions. After discussions with selected parties
and an extensive exploration and evaluation of possible strategic alternatives
to best protect 3dfx's creditors and maximize shareholder value, the 3dfx board
of directors determined that the asset sale to NVIDIA was the only alternative
available to 3dfx that 3dfx believed would best permit 3dfx a reasonable
likelihood of satisfying the claims of its creditors and of placing it in a
position to provide a return to its shareholders. A more complete description
of the background and reasons for the 3dfx board of directors' approval of the
asset sale is set forth under "The Asset Sale--Background" and "--Reasons for
the Asset Sale."

   In the course of the 3dfx board of directors' consideration of the asset
sale in early December 2000, it also considered 3dfx's anticipated prospects
following completion of the asset sale, at which time 3dfx's remaining
operating assets would largely consist of its graphics board business. Although
the board of directors had already decided to exit the business in November
2000, the board re-examined the prospects for this business as well as the
possible application of 3dfx's remaining expertise in other areas, in light of
the proposed asset sale.

   In addition, during this period members of 3dfx management worked with
Robertson Stephens, 3dfx's financial advisor, to assess the strategic and
financial viability of 3dfx continuing as an independent concern following
completion of the proposed asset sale. Following its re-examination of the
stand-alone graphics business, 3dfx's outstanding liabilities and its
consideration of all other available alternatives, the 3dfx board of directors
preliminarily concluded on December 4, 2000 that the liquidation, winding up
and dissolution of 3dfx was the alternative most reasonably likely to allow
payment of its debts and liabilities to its creditors and to maximize the
return of value to its shareholders.

                                       56

   The 3dfx board of directors met on December 15, 2000 with 3dfx's senior
management and its legal and financial advisors. After discussing the structure
and terms of the asset sale and related transactions, the board of directors
again considered 3dfx's alternatives assuming the closing of the asset sale.
During the board of directors' discussions, George Haber and Andrei Manoliu
submitted their resignations as members of 3dfx's board of directors effective
immediately, which resignations were accepted by the 3dfx board of directors.
After further discussion, the 3dfx board of directors concluded in its business
judgment that no other alternative available to 3dfx was reasonably likely to
protect 3dfx's creditors and to provide equal or greater value to 3dfx's
shareholders than the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx. The
board of directors' conclusion was based on a variety of factors that had been
discussed over the course of several meetings, including the following:

  .  an assessment of the likely net proceeds from the asset sale remaining
     after the payment or provision for payment of debts and liabilities owed
     to 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' creditors;

  .  the questionable viability of a business based on 3dfx's remaining
     assets, namely its graphics board business, and the possible
     applicability of 3dfx's remaining expertise in other areas;

  .  the lack of success that 3dfx had already experienced in finding
     strategic buyers or sources of financing for its graphics board
     business;

  .  the financial analysis conducted by Robertson Stephens based on various
     assumptions and data provided to it by 3dfx's management regarding the
     anticipated performance of a stand-alone graphics board business
     following closing of the asset sale, which concluded that the proceeds
     from the asset sale would likely be consumed before the business could
     reach a cash flow positive position or otherwise be in a position to
     obtain new financing;

  .  the attractiveness of potentially being in a position to make a
     distribution to 3dfx's shareholders compared to the board of directors'
     assessment of 3dfx's current and expected future financial condition,
     earnings, business opportunities, strategies and competitive position
     without giving effect to the asset sale and dissolution; and

  .  the comprehensive but unsuccessful efforts of 3dfx to locate alternative
     purchasers for its graphics board assets.

   The 3dfx board of directors also considered potentially negative factors in
its deliberations concerning the dissolution of 3dfx, including the following:

  .  currently existing or future claims against 3dfx, as well as the
     administrative costs of implementing the plan of dissolution, could
     substantially reduce or eliminate any distribution to 3dfx's
     shareholders;

  .  the resolution of currently existing or future claims against 3dfx,
     including any claims of NVIDIA arising out of the purchase agreement,
     may substantially lengthen the time before which any distribution can be
     made to 3dfx's shareholders;

  .  the likelihood that before making any distribution to 3dfx's
     shareholders, 3dfx's common stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq
     National Market, which would likely have an adverse impact on the
     liquidity and price of 3dfx common stock;

  .  the value of NVIDIA common stock may decrease before 3dfx is able to
     make any distribution to its shareholders;

  .  upon completion of the dissolution, 3dfx's shareholders will no longer
     participate in any future earnings or growth of 3dfx's assets or benefit
     from any increases in the value of 3dfx's assets, except possibly in an
     indirect manner as a result of any future appreciation in NVIDIA common
     stock;

  .  the potential for there to be a significant decline in the market price
     of 3dfx common stock as a result of announcement of the dissolution; and

  .  3dfx's shareholders may, depending on their tax basis in their stock,
     recognize a taxable gain upon the completion of the dissolution.

   Based upon the discussion above, the 3dfx board of directors believes that
it has fully explored all of its strategic alternatives. On December 15, 2000,
as a result of that process, the board of directors approved the liquidation,
winding up and dissolution of 3dfx pursuant to the plan of dissolution based
upon its determination that this course of action provided the best protection
to 3dfx's creditors and was in the best interests of 3dfx and its shareholders.
The 3dfx board of directors also directed that the plan of dissolution be
submitted, with the board of director's unanimous recommendation for its
approval, for consideration by 3dfx's shareholders. A copy of the plan of
dissolution is attached to this prospectus/proxy statement as Annex A.

   There can be no assurance that the benefits of the plan of dissolution will
be realized by 3dfx's shareholders. See "Risk Factors."

Recommendation of the 3dfx Board of Directors

   The 3dfx board of directors unanimously recommends that the shareholders
vote FOR the proposal to approve the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of
3dfx pursuant to the plan of dissolution.

Vote Required for Dissolution of 3dfx

   The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of 3dfx common stock is required to approve the liquidation, winding up and
dissolution of 3dfx pursuant to the plan of dissolution.

   Pursuant to voting agreements and related irrevocable proxies, 887,313
outstanding shares of 3dfx common stock (which excludes shares subject to stock
options) beneficially owned by executive officers and directors of 3dfx and
their affiliates on     , 2001, representing approximately 2.2% of the total
number of shares of 3dfx common stock outstanding at that date, will be voted
for approval of the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx as
described in the plan of dissolution.

Description of the Plan of Dissolution

   The plan of dissolution provides for the dissolution, winding up and
dissolution of 3dfx pursuant to the California Corporations Code. The plan of
dissolution provides that, following approval by 3dfx's shareholders, 3dfx will
proceed with the closing of the asset sale and the liquidation of its other
assets, and will wind up its business and operations and dissolve. To the
extent that there are any remaining assets after the payment of, or the
provision for the payment of, 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debts and
liabilities, 3dfx will distribute such assets to its shareholders in one or
more distributions. See "--Expected Distributions."

   The plan of dissolution grants broad discretion and authority to 3dfx's
board of directors in the administration of the plan of dissolution, including
the engagement of employees and consultants to facilitate the dissolution of
3dfx, the provision for indemnification of 3dfx's directors and officers,
payment of all of its and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities,
establishment of a liquidating trust and the determination of the timing and
amount of distributions. In addition, the plan of dissolution provides that
3dfx's board of directors may amend or delay implementation of the plan of
dissolution even if it is approved by a majority of 3dfx shareholders.

Operations of 3dfx

   After the closing of the asset sale, 3dfx will cease business operations,
other than managing its investments in cash, cash equivalents and other
marketable securities. Its corporate existence will continue thereafter, but
solely for the purpose of managing such investments, completing work in
process, disposing of its assets, providing for the satisfaction of its and its
subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, adjusting and winding up its business and
affairs, and distributing any remaining assets to shareholders. It is unlikely
that any further approvals by 3dfx shareholders will be sought in connection
with any action relating to the liquidation process. One or more liquidating
distributions from any remaining assets will be conditioned upon setting aside
sufficient assets for the purpose of meeting any debts and liabilities that
3dfx and/or its subsidiaries have not otherwise met.

                                       58
<PAGE>

Payment of Claims Related to 3dfx

   3dfx intends to satisfy, or provide for the satisfaction of, all of its
debts and liabilities. The plan of dissolution also authorizes the board of
directors to pay or provide for the payment of the debts and liabilities of
3dfx's subsidiaries, if such debts and liabilities are enforceable against 3dfx
or if the board of directors in the exercise of its business judgment believes
the payment or provision for these debts and liabilities will ultimately result
in the maximization of assets available for distribution to 3dfx's
shareholders.

   The 3dfx board of directors, in the exercise of its business judgment, will
likely determine to pay the debts and liabilities of 3dfx's subsidiaries in
accordance with the plan of dissolution. Under principles of corporate
separateness, an argument can be made that 3dfx is not required to pay such
claims. Nonetheless, the 3dfx board of directors elected to provide for the
payment of the claims of creditors of its subsidiaries in the plan of
dissolution mainly for three reasons: first, 3dfx and its subsidiaries have
made intercompany cash transfers; second, payment will diminish costly
litigation by subsidiary creditors who might seek to disregard the corporate
separateness between 3dfx and its subsidiaries, leading perhaps to a reduction
in the distributions that may be made to 3dfx's shareholders; and third, the
terms of the purchase agreement require that the claims of subsidiaries be
paid.

   3dfx believes that the cash proceeds from the asset sale received at closing
will be insufficient to satisfy all of 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debts and
liabilities. As a consequence, 3dfx expects that it will request that NVIDIA US
Investment Company advance to it up to $25 million to be used by 3dfx to pay
the remaining debts owed to its or its subsidiaries' creditors. If, upon
satisfaction of various conditions, the advance is made by NVIDIA US Investment
Company, the number of shares of NVIDIA common stock deliverable to 3dfx will
be reduced by the quotient determined by dividing the amount of the advance by
$50. 3dfx expects that, upon receiving the cash consideration at the closing of
the asset sale and after obtaining the cash advance from NVIDIA US Investment
Company, it will have sufficient cash to pay all of its and its subsidiaries'
known current and determinable liabilities.

Directors and Officers of 3dfx

   3dfx anticipates that its current directors, and one or more of its current
officers, will continue to serve in such capacities after adoption of the plan
of dissolution for such purposes as are set forth under the California
Corporations Code, including implementing the plan of dissolution. The board of
directors will be given broad powers to take whatever action is necessary or
desirable in order to carry out the provisions of the plan of dissolution to
effect the complete liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx.

Continued Indemnification of Directors and Officers of 3dfx

   3dfx expects to reserve assets and/or obtain and maintain insurance to
provide for the continued indemnification of the directors, officers, agents
and representatives of 3dfx, and any other parties whom 3dfx has agreed to
indemnify, as provided by the charter documents of 3dfx, any existing
indemnification agreements between 3dfx and any of such persons, and applicable
law. The establishment or application of any assets dedicated to these reserves
will delay, and may reduce, the assets available for distribution to 3dfx's
shareholders. At the discretion of the board of directors, insurance may
include coverage for periods after the dissolution of 3dfx, including periods
after the termination of any liquidating trust and coverage for trustees,
employees and agents of such liquidating trust.

Dissolution; No Transfers

   After all of 3dfx's assets have been sold, all of its and its subsidiaries'
known and contingent debts and liabilities have been paid and discharged, or
adequate provision has otherwise been made for such debts and liabilities, and
all net proceeds have been distributed to or for the benefit of 3dfx
shareholders, 3dfx will file a certificate of dissolution with the Secretary of
State of the State of California or obtain a court order declaring 3dfx
dissolved and file that order with the Secretary of State of California. Upon
filing of the certificate of

                                       59
<PAGE>

dissolution or court order, 3dfx will cease to exist as a legal entity and will
be dissolved. The stock transfer books of 3dfx will be closed as of the close
of business on the date the Secretary of State of the State of California
accepts the filing of 3dfx's certificate of dissolution or court order.
Thereafter, no assignments or transfers of 3dfx common stock will be recorded.

Expected Distributions

   The actual amount of, timing of, and record dates for, any distributions to
3dfx's shareholders are not known at this time. These matters will be
determined after the commencement of liquidation proceedings, in the sole
discretion of the 3dfx board of directors or the trustees of the liquidating
trust, as the case may be, and will depend upon a variety of factors, including
the timing of the closing of the asset sale, the net proceeds received in the
asset sale, the value of 3dfx's other assets, the ultimate amount of known and
unknown debts and liabilities of 3dfx and its subsidiaries and the amount of
liquidation-related expenses that must be satisfied out of 3dfx's assets.
Claims, liabilities and expenses will continue to accrue following approval of
the plan of dissolution, and 3dfx anticipates that expenses for professional
fees and other expenses of dissolution will be significant. These expenses will
reduce the amount of the assets available for distribution to 3dfx
shareholders.

   At this time, 3dfx cannot determine if there will be any assets remaining
after paying for, or providing for the payment of, all of its and its
subsidiaries' debts and liabilities. 3dfx expects that following the closing of
the asset sale it will request that NVIDIA US Investment Company provide a cash
advance of all or a portion of the $25 million provided for in the purchase
agreement in order to enable 3dfx to pay its or its subsidiaries creditors. If
a cash advance is made to 3dfx, then the number of NVIDIA shares receivable by
3dfx will be reduced by a number of shares determined by dividing the amount of
the advance by $50. 3dfx expects that, upon receiving the cash consideration at
the closing of the asset sale and after obtaining the cash advance from NVIDIA
US Investment Company, it will have sufficient cash to pay all of its and its
subsidiaries' known current and determinable liabilities. However, the amount
of unknown or contingent liabilities cannot be quantified and could decrease or
eliminate any remaining assets available for distribution. Further, if 3dfx or
its subsidiaries are subject to any contingent liabilities, this could require
that it establish reserves that could delay any distribution to 3dfx
shareholders.

   Because of the uncertainties as to the precise net realizable value of
3dfx's assets and the settlement amount of 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debts
and liabilities, 3dfx cannot at this time determine the amount of distributions
that may be made to its shareholders, if any. Only if there are assets
remaining at the time of the dissolution will you receive a portion of those
assets, which will be equal to your pro rata share, based on the number of 3dfx
shares you own.

   3dfx expects to receive a combination of cash and shares of NVIDIA common
stock in connection with the asset sale. 3dfx may distribute the shares of
NVIDIA common stock received by it following its dissolution directly to its
shareholders, or it may sell these shares in the open market or contribute the
shares to a liquidating trust for the benefit of 3dfx's shareholders. Further,
3dfx may elect to directly distribute shares of NVIDIA common stock to some of
its shareholders, while distributing an equivalent per share value in cash to
others who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional amount or small
number of shares of NVIDIA common stock. At this time, 3dfx is unable to
provide specifics about the type or types of assets that 3dfx's shareholders
may receive or what the value of those assets might be at the time of
distribution, if a distribution is made to 3dfx's shareholders by 3dfx or a
liquidating trust at all.

   After the closing of the asset sale, the prices at which 3dfx will seek to
sell its remaining assets will be determined by 3dfx management and board of
directors in their sole discretion. The assets could be sold to one or more
purchasers, in one or more transactions over a period of time. The amount of
proceeds received from the disposition of individual assets is dependent on a
number of conditions, many of which are beyond 3dfx's power to control.

   3dfx shareholders will be advised at the time of any such distribution as to
the details of the mechanics of distribution and the procedures as to
dissolution.

                                       60
<PAGE>

   In the event that 3dfx were to make distributions to its shareholders
without payment or adequate provision for payment of its or its subsidiary's
debts and liabilities, each shareholder could be required to return up to the
amount of total distributions such shareholder received.

Amendment or Delay of Implementation of the Plan of Dissolution

   The 3dfx board of directors may amend or delay implementation of the plan of
dissolution without the necessity of further shareholder approval, unless the
board of directors determines that such amendment or delay would materially and
adversely affect shareholders' interests.

Liquidating Trust

   If deemed necessary or desirable by the 3dfx board of directors, 3dfx may
during the course of the liquidation process transfer some or all of its then
remaining assets to a liquidating trust for the benefit of the shareholders of
3dfx. The liquidating trust would also likely assume some or all of the
liabilities of 3dfx and its subsidiaries remaining at the time of the transfer
of assets. Any such liquidating trust would be administered by one or more
trustees selected by the board of directors and appointed pursuant to a
liquidating trust agreement. In the event a liquidating trust is established,
3dfx would distribute to its then current holders of common stock beneficial
interests in the liquidating trust in proportion to the number of shares of
common stock owned by such holders. The sole purpose of the liquidating trust
would be to liquidate the assets transferred to the liquidating trust on terms
satisfactory to the liquidating trustees, to pay any liabilities of 3dfx
assumed by the liquidating trust, and to distribute to the holders of the
common stock of 3dfx any assets remaining in the liquidating trust after the
completion of this process. The liquidating trust would be obligated to pay any
debts and liabilities of 3dfx and its subsidiaries assumed by it. Approval of
the plan of dissolution will constitute the approval by 3dfx shareholders of
the board of directors' establishment of such a liquidating trust, its
appointment of one or more individuals (who may or may not be former directors)
or corporate persons to act as trustee or trustees and the terms of any
liquidating trust agreement adopted by the board of directors. It is
anticipated that the beneficial interests in the liquidating trust would not be
freely transferable. Therefore, the recipients of the beneficial interests
would not realize any value from the interests unless and until the liquidating
trust distributes cash or other assets to them, which would be solely in the
discretion of the trustees.

   The board of directors may utilize a liquidating trust to reserve assets of
3dfx for the future satisfaction of contingent liabilities. This might enable
3dfx to complete its dissolution and, potentially, to distribute assets to its
shareholders without delaying those actions until the validity and amounts of
the contingent liabilities have been determined. If it appears that the
disposition of particular assets held by 3dfx will require substantial time or
substantial attention on the part of an administrator with particular skills or
experience, a liquidating trust could be used so that those assets could be
disposed of in an orderly fashion by one or more trustees with the requisite
skills and experience. Using a liquidating trust for this purpose might enable
3dfx to complete its dissolution and, potentially, to make an initial
distribution of assets to its shareholders without delaying such actions until
3dfx could dispose of these particular assets on a favorable basis.

   From and after the date of 3dfx's transfer of its remaining assets to the
liquidating trust, 3dfx would no longer have an interest of any character in
and to these assets, which would thereafter be held by the liquidating trust
for the purposes set forth in the plan of dissolution.

   The activities of the liquidating trust would be limited to selling the
assets it receives from 3dfx, using the proceeds of such asset sales to
discharge 3dfx's and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities, and distributing
any remaining assets to 3dfx's shareholders. Because 3dfx's shareholders would
be considered the owners of the liquidating trust's assets for tax purposes,
each shareholder would be required to take into account in computing his own
taxable income his pro rata share of each item of the trust's income, gain,
loss and deduction. Distributions received from the trust would not be
separately taxable. See "--Material Tax Consequences of the Liquidation and
Dissolution of 3dfx."

Nasdaq Listing

   Since 3dfx's common stock no longer meets all of the requirements for
listing on the Nasdaq National Market, 3dfx's common stock may be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market in the near future. After delisting, the ability to
buy and sell shares of 3dfx common stock may be materially impaired, which
would likely have an adverse effect on the price and liquidity of 3dfx common
stock.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Liquidation and Dissolution of
3dfx

   The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of 3dfx's adoption and implementation of the plan of dissolution.
This discussion is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations and does
not include a discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. In
addition, the discussion is intended to address only those federal income tax
considerations that are generally applicable to all United States shareholders
and does not discuss all of the aspects of federal income taxation that may be
relevant to certain types of 3dfx shareholders (including insurance companies,
tax-exempt entities, financial institutions, broker-dealers, foreign
corporations, persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States,
shareholders who acquired their shares in connection with stock option or stock
purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions, shareholders whose shares
are "qualified small business stock" for purposes of Section 1202 of the
Internal Revenue Code or are "section 1244 stock" for purposes of Section 1244
of the Internal Revenue Code, shareholders who hold their shares as part of an
integrated investment such as a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or other
risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction, and
shareholders who do not hold their shares as capital assets) who are subject to
special treatment under the federal income tax laws.

   This discussion is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
and its legislative history, existing, temporary and currently proposed
Treasury Regulations, existing administrative rulings and practices of the
Internal Revenue Service or IRS, and judicial decisions. No assurance can be
given that legislative, judicial or administrative changes will not affect the
accuracy of this discussion, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, 3dfx
has not requested and does not plan to request any rulings from the IRS with
respect to the tax consequences of the adoption and implementation of the plan
of dissolution. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the statements
contained in this discussion (which do not bind the IRS or the courts) will not
be challenged by the IRS or sustained by the courts if so challenged.

   This discussion is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning.
Each shareholder is urged to consult with its own tax advisor regarding the
specific tax consequences of the adoption and implementation of the plan of
dissolution, including the federal, state, local, and foreign tax consequences
that may be applicable to such shareholder.

Tax Consequences of the Liquidation to 3dfx

   Even though the liquidation of 3dfx could involve a distribution
predominantly of NVIDIA common stock, the liquidation will not constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
with respect to 3dfx. In addition to the possible distribution of NVIDIA common
stock, the liquidation could also involve a distribution of cash or of 3dfx
property directly or through a liquidating trust. See discussion below under
"Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Liquidating Trust." 3dfx will
recognize gain or loss on its distribution of property (NVIDIA stock or other
property) to its shareholders in complete liquidation of 3dfx, as if it sold
the distributed property to its distributee--shareholders for the fair market
value of such property on the date of the distribution. If the property
distributed in the liquidation is subject to a liability or the distributee
shareholder assumes a liability of the liquidating corporation in connection
with the distribution, the fair market value of the property is treated as not
less than the amount of the liability. The 3dfx gain or loss recognized
pursuant to its liquidation will be in addition to the gain or loss recognized
by 3dfx pursuant to the asset sale. See "The Asset Sale--Material Federal
Income Tax Consequences Relating to the Asset Sale." 3dfx will be obligated to
file Form 966 with the Internal Revenue

                                       62
<PAGE>

Service within 30 days after the shareholders approve the plan of dissolution.
In addition, 3dfx will be obligated to satisfy certain reporting requirements
with respect to the distributions to its shareholders.

Tax Consequences of the Liquidation to 3dfx Shareholders

   Even though the liquidation of 3dfx could involve a distribution
predominantly of NVIDIA common stock, the liquidation will not constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
with respect to the 3dfx shareholders. Distributions in complete liquidation of
3dfx pursuant to the plan of dissolution generally will be treated by each 3dfx
shareholder as amounts received in full payment in exchange for its stock under
Section 331(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The distributions will not be
treated as dividends received by each shareholder, but rather as if the
shareholder sold its shares. Each shareholder receiving such liquidating
distributions will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i)
the sum of the amount of cash and the net fair market value of other property
received (including the fair market value of an interest in any liquidating
trust, as described below) and (ii) the shareholder's basis in its 3dfx shares.
A shareholder who recognizes gain may not receive any cash from 3dfx with which
to satisfy the resulting tax liability.

   A shareholder's gain or loss attributable to the liquidation of 3dfx
generally will be capital gain or loss if the shareholder's shares are held as
a "capital asset" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Presently, capital gains generally are taxed to individual taxpayers at a
maximum rate of 20% with respect to capital assets held for more than one year.
Individual shareholders may deduct capital losses to the extent of their
capital gains, plus $3,000 ($1,500 in the case of a married individual filing a
separate return). Any unused capital loss may be carried forward indefinitely
by individual taxpayers until the individual recognizes sufficient capital
gains to absorb them or recognizes such losses at the rate of up to $3,000 per
year ($1,500 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return).
Capital losses may not be carried back by an individual. Corporate shareholders
may deduct capital losses in the year recognized only to the extent of capital
gains recognized during such year. Unused capital losses of a corporation may
be carried back three years and forward for five years, but may not be carried
to any year in which they would create or increase a net operating loss.

   If there is a distribution to 3dfx shareholders, the distribution could
consist of one or more liquidating distributions. Each liquidating distribution
will be applied first against the adjusted tax basis of each of a shareholder's
shares, and gain will be recognized with respect to a share only after an
amount equal to the adjusted tax basis of such share has been fully recovered.
Any loss with respect to a share may be recognized only after 3dfx makes its
final liquidating distribution, if any, or after the last substantial
liquidating distribution is determinable with reasonable certainty. Gain or
loss is computed on a share by share basis. If a shareholder owns several
blocks of shares with different tax bases and holding periods, each liquidating
distribution must be allocated ratably among the several blocks of shares in
the proportion that the number of shares in a particular block bears to the
total number of shares owned by the shareholder.

   In summary, each shareholder should not recognize any gain associated with
each liquidating distribution until the aggregate amount of these distributions
exceeds such shareholder's basis in its shares. At such time that the aggregate
amount of liquidating distributions exceed a shareholder's basis in its shares,
such shareholder will recognize gain equal to such excess. Such gain will
qualify for capital gain treatment (long-term if the shares have been held for
more than one year) if the shareholder's shares are held as a "capital asset."
Otherwise, this gain will represent ordinary income to the shareholder. In the
event that a shareholder's basis in its shares exceeds the aggregate
liquidating distributions such shareholder receives for these shares pursuant
to the plan of dissolution, such shareholder will be entitled to claim a loss.
A shareholder will be allowed to recognize such loss only after 3dfx makes its
final liquidating distribution.

   As each shareholder will have a different basis in its shares, each
shareholder will be responsible for calculating its own gain or loss in
connection with liquidating distributions it receives from 3dfx. Each
shareholder is advised to consult with its own tax advisor as to these gain and
loss calculations.

Tax Consequences of the Liquidating Trust

   If deemed advisable by the 3dfx board of directors, it may cause 3dfx to
establish a liquidating trust to which 3dfx could distribute in kind its
remaining assets. Under the Internal Revenue Code, a trust will be treated as a
liquidating trust if it is organized for the primary purpose of liquidating and
distributing the assets transferred to it, and if its activities are all
reasonably necessary to and consistent with the accomplishment of that purpose.
However, if the liquidation is prolonged or if the liquidation purpose becomes
so obscured by business activities that the declared purpose of the liquidation
can be said to be lost or abandoned, it will no longer be considered a
liquidating trust. Although neither the Internal Revenue Code nor the
regulations thereunder provide any specific guidance as to the length of time a
liquidating trust may last, the Internal Revenue Service's guidelines for
issuing rulings with respect to liquidating trust status call for a term not to
exceed three years, which period may be extended to cover the collection of
installment obligations.

   An entity classified as a liquidating trust may receive assets, including
cash, from the liquidating entity without the trust incurring any tax. It will
be treated as a grantor trust, and accordingly, will also not be subject to tax
on any income or gain recognized by it. Instead, each beneficiary will be
treated as the owner of its pro rata portion of each asset, including cash,
received by and held by the liquidating trust. Accordingly, if the plan of
dissolution is approved and if 3dfx ultimately employs a liquidating trust,
each shareholder would, at the time of the distribution of the interests in the
liquidating trust, be treated as having received a liquidating distribution
equal to its share of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any asset
distributed to the liquidating trust. This distribution will be taken into
account in computing a shareholder's gain or loss attributable to the
liquidation. In addition, each shareholder would be required to take into
account in computing its own taxable income its pro rata share of each item of
income, gain and loss of the liquidating trust. Since shareholders would be
treated as owning their respective shares of the liquidating trust's assets,
they would be treated as directly engaging in the operations of the trust. As
such, shareholders that are tax-exempt entities may realize "unrelated business
taxable income" with respect to the trust's activities and foreign investors
may be considered to receive income that is "effectively connected" with a U.S.
trade or business. A full discussion of the consequences to tax-exempt and
foreign shareholders of using a liquidating trust is beyond the scope of this
document and 3dfx shareholders should consult their own tax advisors.

   An individual shareholder who itemizes deductions would be entitled to
deduct its pro rata share of fees and expenses of the liquidating trust only to
the extent that such amount, together with the shareholder's other
miscellaneous deductions, exceeded 2% of its adjusted gross income. A
shareholder would also recognize taxable gain or loss when all or part of its
pro rata portion of an asset is disposed of for an amount greater or less than
its pro rata portion of the fair market value of such asset at the time it was
transferred to the liquidating trust. Any such gain or loss would be capital
gain or loss so long as the shareholder held its interest in the assets as a
capital asset.

   If a liquidating trust fails to qualify as such, its treatment will depend
upon, among other things, the reasons for its failure to so qualify. It most
likely would be taxable as a corporation. In such case, the liquidating trust
itself would be subject to tax, and shareholders could also be subject to tax
upon the receipt of certain distributions from the liquidating trust. If the
board determines to make use of a liquidating trust, it is anticipated that
commercially reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that the trust will be
classified as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes.

Special Considerations Applicable to Non-U.S. Shareholders

   Because distributions to 3dfx shareholders following adoption of the plan of
dissolution will be treated as payments in exchange for their stock and not as
dividends, 3dfx will not be required to withhold any amounts with respect to
such distributions to a non-U.S. shareholder unless the non-U.S. shareholder's
shares are treated as "United States real property interests" under the
provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, as
amended, or FIRPTA. If 3dfx's shares were to constitute United States real
property interests in the hands of a non-U.S. shareholder, 3dfx would be
required under Section 1445(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue

                                       64
<PAGE>

Code to withhold 10% of the gross amount of each liquidating distribution to
such shareholder (even if the shareholder recognizes a loss on the
distribution). In addition, the non-U.S. shareholder would be subject to
regular U.S. income tax with respect to any gain or loss realized on the deemed
sale of such shares resulting from the receipt of liquidating distributions.
However, the shares of 3dfx should not be treated as "United States real
property interests."

   Although 3dfx will not be required to withhold against liquidating
distributions to any non-U.S. shareholder unless its shares constitute United
States real property interests with respect to such shareholder, a non-U.S.
shareholder who is not subject to withholding nevertheless will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax with respect to liquidating distributions from 3dfx
under the following circumstances. First, if a non-U.S. shareholder's
investment in 3dfx's shares is effectively connected with the non-U.S.
shareholder's U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. shareholder will be subject
to the same treatment as U.S. shareholders with respect to liquidating
distributions from 3dfx, and if the non-U.S. shareholder is a corporation, it
may also be subject to the branch profits tax. Second, if the non-U.S.
shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United
States for 183 days or more during the taxable year in which the liquidating
distributions are received and certain other conditions apply, the nonresident
alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual's capital
gains.

   Non-U.S. shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of receiving liquidating distributions
from 3dfx, including the consequences that would apply if 3dfx were to
contribute its assets to a liquidating trust.

State and Local Income Tax

   Shareholders also may be subject to state or local income taxes with respect
to distributions received by them pursuant to the plan of dissolution and
should consult their tax advisors regarding such taxes.

   The above discussion of tax matters does not attempt to discuss all tax
matters that may affect 3dfx or its shareholders in the course of the
liquidation, winding up and dissolution, or to consider various facts or
limitations applicable to any particular shareholder. Shareholders are urged to
consult their own tax advisers with respect to the tax consequences to them of
the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx.

Absence of Dissenters' Rights Related to the Dissolution of 3dfx

   California law does not provide dissenters' rights with respect to the
dissolution, winding up and liquidation of 3dfx.

                    MATERIAL TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

   The following description of the purchase agreement describes the material
terms of the purchase agreement. The full text of the purchase agreement is
attached as Annex B to, and is included as part of, this prospectus/proxy
statement. You are encouraged to read the entire purchase agreement carefully.

The Purchase Agreement

   The purchase agreement provides that NVIDIA US Investment Company will
purchase certain of the assets of 3dfx, including the core graphics processor
assets of 3dfx. Specifically, the purchase agreement provides that 3dfx will
sell the following assets:

  . patent and patent applications;

  . trademarks, trademark applications, trade names, service marks and
    service mark applications;

  . other proprietary assets such as trade secrets, copyrights, inventions,
    designs, drawings and research;

  . inventory and equipment related to 3dfx's core graphics processor assets,
    including the entire inventory of graphics chips;

  . rights under certain contracts; and

  . other assets, rights and proceeds from the sale of assets related to the
    graphics business.

   Contemporaneously with the purchase agreement, NVIDIA, NVIDIA US Investment
Company and 3dfx entered into other agreements which provided for the transfer
or licensing of certain of 3dfx's assets. For example, in connection with a $15
million loan to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement, 3dfx assigned all of its
trademarks, tradenames, trademark applications, service marks and service mark
applications to NVIDIA US Investment Company pursuant to a trademark assignment
agreement. NVIDIA US Investment Company will own these marks regardless of
whether the asset sale closes. See "Other Related Agreements--Credit Agreement,
Security Agreement and Trademark Assignment." In addition, pursuant to a patent
license agreement, 3dfx licensed most of its patents, patent applications and
inventions to NVIDIA US Investment Company and NVIDIA licensed most of its
patents, patent applications and inventions to 3dfx. The license to NVIDIA will
remain in force even if the purchase agreement is terminated as a result of
shareholders voting against the asset sale and dissolution of 3dfx. See "Other
Related Agreements--Patent License." In the event of termination of the
purchase agreement, 3dfx will be obligated to repay $5 million of the $15
million loan made pursuant to the credit agreement.

Purchase Price

   The terms of the purchase agreement provide that NVIDIA US Investment
Company will pay 3dfx $70 million in cash and, subject to specified conditions,
1,000,000 shares of common stock of NVIDIA. NVIDIA US Investment Company must
deliver the shares of common stock of NVIDIA to 3dfx only upon NVIDIA US
Investment Company's receipt of a certificate from the chief executive officer
or chief financial officer of 3dfx certifying that (i) the shareholders of 3dfx
duly adopted resolutions approving the liquidation, winding up and dissolution
of 3dfx in accordance with the California Corporations Code; (ii) all debts and
liabilities of 3dfx and its subsidiaries' were satisfied or paid in full or
otherwise provided for from sources other than the stock consideration; and
(iii) 3dfx has been (or upon only the filing of a certificate of dissolution or
court order will be) validly dissolved under the California Corporations Code.
NVIDIA US Investment Company is not obligated to deliver these shares, however,
unless it is satisfied that 3dfx has paid in full or otherwise adequately
provided for payment of all of its and its subsidiaries' debts and liabilities.

   3dfx may request, after the closing of the asset sale and prior to the
payment of the common stock consideration, that NVIDIA US Investment Company
make a one-time advance to 3dfx up to $25 million if

                                       66
<PAGE>

3dfx determines that assets of 3dfx, including the $70 million delivered at the
closing, are or will be insufficient to pay in full any remaining liabilities
of 3dfx or its subsidiaries, and that these remaining debts and liabilities
would be paid in full if 3dfx had access to funds not exceeding $25 million.
NVIDIA US Investment Company is not required to provide 3dfx with the advance
if it determines in good faith that the funds requested would not permit 3dfx
to pay in full the then-remaining liabilities of 3dfx. If NVIDIA US Investment
Company does make the payment of up to $25 million, the number of shares of
common stock of NVIDIA to be paid to 3dfx would be reduced by a number of
shares determined by dividing the amount of the advance by $50.

Expected Timing of the Transaction

   The parties expect that the transaction will close as soon as possible after
the necessary governmental and shareholder approvals have been obtained. The
purchase agreement provides that if the closing has not occurred by May 15,
2001, then, subject to certain conditions described more fully in this
prospectus/proxy statement, either party may terminate the agreement.

Representations and Warranties

   The purchase agreement contains representations and warranties by 3dfx to
NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company regarding aspects of 3dfx's and its
subsidiaries' assets, business, financial condition, structure and other facts
pertinent to the asset sale. The representations and warranties will expire one
year following the closing, provided, however, that NVIDIA and NVIDIA US
Investment Company's representations and warranties will expire no later than
the date that the shares of common stock of NVIDIA are paid to 3dfx, and the
representations and warranties of 3dfx may expire longer than one year after
the closing if a valid claim has been made against 3dfx relating to a possible
breach of 3dfx's representations and warranties prior to the first anniversary
of the closing. If such a claim is made, then the representation or warranty
that is the subject of the claim will survive until there is a final resolution
of the claim. The representations and warranties made by 3dfx cover the

   . the presence of any hazardous materials at any site owned, leased,

that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by NVIDIA, NVIDIA US
Investment Company or any of their affiliates or representatives, or to which
any of the above described indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject,
exceeds $1 million in the aggregate. If the total amount of the damages exceeds

                                       69
<PAGE>

   3dfx's obligations to close the asset sale are subject to the satisfaction

    purchase agreement; and

  . NVIDIA's representations and warranties contained in the purchase
    agreement must be accurate in all material respects as of the closing of
    the asset sale and as of the date of the purchase agreement, without
    giving effect to any update to the disclosure schedule, and except for
    any such representations and warranties that are made as of a specific
    date, which, in such case, must be accurate in all material respects as
    of such date.

   NVIDIA US Investment Company's and NVIDIA's obligations to close the asset

    been received;

  . 3dfx's representations and warranties contained in the purchase agreement
    must be accurate in all material respects as of the closing of the asset

    which, in such case, must be accurate in all material respects as of such
    date;

  . NVIDIA must have received the written legal opinion of Locke Liddell &
    Sapp LLP and, if requested by NVIDIA, the written opinion of a nationally
    recognized investment bank regarding 3dfx's solvency;

  . 3dfx must repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility, subject to
    the terms of the credit agreement; and

  . NVIDIA US Investment Company must receive evidence satisfactory to it of
    the release of encumbrances on the assets being purchased.

Limitation on 3dfx's Ability to Consider Other Acquisition Proposals

   3dfx has agreed that it will not directly or indirectly, and will not
authorize or permit any of its representatives directly or indirectly to:

  . solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission
    or announcement of any acquisition proposal or take any action that could
    reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

  . furnish any information regarding 3dfx or its subsidiaries to any person
    in connection with or in response to an acquisition proposal or an
    inquiry or indication of interest that could lead to an acquisition
    proposal;

  . engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any
    acquisition proposal;

  . approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal; or

  . enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract
    contemplating or otherwise relating to any acquisition transaction.

   However, these restrictions shall not be deemed to prevent 3dfx or its board
of directors from complying with its legal obligations under Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with regard to an acquisition
proposal. Furthermore, these restrictions will not prohibit 3dfx from
furnishing nonpublic

                                       70
<PAGE>

information regarding 3dfx or its subsidiaries to, or entering into discussion
with, any person in response to a superior offer that is submitted by that
person if:

  . neither 3dfx nor any representative of 3dfx has breached or taken any
    action inconsistent with the restrictions described above;

  . the board of directors of 3dfx concludes in good faith, after having
    consulted with 3dfx's outside legal counsel, that such action is required
    in order for the board of directors of 3dfx to comply with its fiduciary
    obligations to 3dfx's shareholders under applicable law;

  . at least five business days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
    information to, or entering into discussions with, that person, 3dfx
    gives NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company written notice of the
    identity of that person and of 3dfx's intention to furnish nonpublic
    information to, or enter into discussions with, that person, and 3dfx
    receives from that person an executed confidentiality agreement
    containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
    nonpublic written and oral information furnished to that person by or on
    behalf of 3dfx and containing provisions no less favorable to 3dfx than
    certain provisions contained in the confidentiality agreement between
    NVIDIA and 3dfx; and

  . at least five business days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
    information to such person, 3dfx furnishes such nonpublic information to
    NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company (to the extent such nonpublic
    information has not been previously furnished by 3dfx to NVIDIA and
    NVIDIA US Investment Company).

   A superior offer means an unsolicited, bona fide written offer by a third
party, which has either a firm financing commitment or is otherwise capable of
providing financing, to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock
of 3dfx or certain of the assets of 3dfx on terms the board of directors of
3dfx determines, in its reasonable judgment, based upon a written opinion of an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to be more
favorable to the shareholders of 3dfx than the terms of the asset sale and
dissolution of 3dfx.

   If prior to closing of the asset sale, 3dfx's board of directors receives an
acquisition proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or any request for
nonpublic information, then 3dfx must, within 48 hours of receipt of such
acquisition proposal or inquiry, advise NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company
orally and in writing of such matter (including the identity of the person
making or submitting such acquisition proposal, inquiry, indication of interest
or request, and the terms thereof). 3dfx must keep NVIDIA and NVIDIA US
Investment Company fully informed with respect to the status of any such
acquisition proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request and any
modification or proposed modification thereto.

   3dfx has agreed not to release or permit the release of any person from, or
to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality,
"standstill," nonsolicitation or similar agreement to which 3dfx is a party or
under which 3dfx has any rights, and will use its best efforts to enforce or
cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of NVIDIA and NVIDIA US
Investment Company 3dfx also agreed to promptly request each person that has
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a
possible acquisition transaction or equity investment to return all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of
3dfx.

   3dfx is still obligated to call a shareholder meeting on the asset sale and
dissolution of 3dfx that is the subject of this prospectus/proxy statement even
if it has a superior offer, although in certain circumstances the board of
directors of 3dfx may withdraw or modify their board recommendation for certain
superior offers.

Termination of the Purchase Agreement

   NVIDIA, 3dfx and NVIDIA US Investment Company can agree by mutual written
consent to terminate the purchase agreement at any time prior to the closing of
the asset sale. In addition, either NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company or
3dfx may terminate the purchase agreement if:

  . the purchase agreement and related agreements have not been completed by
    May 15, 2001, unless the failure to complete the purchase agreement and
    related agreements is attributable to a failure on the part of the party
    seeking to terminate the purchase agreement to perform any covenant
    required to be performed by such party at or prior to the closing of the
    asset sale;

  . a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body issues a
    final and nonappealable order, decree or ruling or shall have taken any
    other action having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
    otherwise prohibiting the asset sale and related transactions;

  . the 3dfx shareholders fail to approve both the asset sale and the
    dissolution of 3dfx, unless the failure to obtain the approval is
    attributable to a failure on the part of the party seeking to terminate
    the purchase agreement to perform any covenant required to be performed
    by such party at or prior to the closing of the asset sale; or

  . the representations and warranties of the other party in the purchase
    agreement are or become inaccurate, or the other party breaches its
    covenants, such that a condition to the obligation of the party to which
    such representations and warranties or covenants are made would not be
    satisfied and the inaccuracy or breach is not curable through the
    exercise of reasonable efforts or the other party is not using reasonable
    efforts to cure the breach.

   In addition, NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company, at any time prior to
the approval by the 3dfx shareholders of the asset sale and plan of
dissolution, may terminate the purchase agreement if any of the following
events, which constitute triggering events under the purchase agreement,
occurs:

  . the 3dfx board of directors fails to recommend that the 3dfx shareholders
    vote to approve the asset sale and plan of dissolution, or withdraws or
    modifies its recommendation or takes any other action that becomes
    generally known to the 3dfx shareholders and that would be reasonably
    construed to suggest that the 3dfx board or directors does not support
    the asset sale or plan of dissolution and does not believe the asset sale

    or otherwise prohibits the asset sale.

   In some situations, termination of the purchase agreement may have
implications on the patent license agreement, patent standstill agreement and
the credit agreement. See "Other Related Agreements."

Termination Fees

   The purchase agreement provides that if it is terminated because the asset
sale was not completed by May 15, 2001, then 3dfx would be required to pay:

  . fees to reimburse NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company for their
    reasonable fees and expenses that have been paid or that may become
    payable by and on behalf of NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company in
    connection with the preparation and negotiation of the purchase agreement
    and the documents concerning the related transactions and otherwise in
    connection with the asset sale and related transactions, if at or prior
    to the time of the termination of the purchase agreement, an acquisition
    proposal for 3dfx has been disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or
    made and has not been withdrawn or terminated pursuant to a public
    announcement at least five days before the special shareholders' meeting;
    and

  . a fee of $3.3 million if at or prior to the termination of the purchase
    agreement, an acquisition proposal for 3dfx had been disclosed,
    announced, commenced, submitted or made.

   The purchase agreement also provides that if the agreement is terminated
because the 3dfx shareholders did not approve the dissolution of 3dfx and asset
sale, then 3dfx would be required to pay:

  . fees to reimburse NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company for their
    reasonable fees and expenses that have been paid or that may become

    agreement, an acquisition proposal for 3dfx had been disclosed,

                               VOTING AGREEMENTS

   The following description of the voting agreements sets forth the material
terms of the voting agreements.

   All of the directors and executive officers of 3dfx have entered into
voting agreements with NVIDIA dated December 15, 2000. They have agreed in the
voting agreements to vote all shares of 3dfx common stock owned by them as of
the record date in favor of the approval of the asset sale pursuant to the
purchase agreement and the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx as
described in the plan of dissolution. They have also granted NVIDIA an
irrevocable proxy to vote their shares of 3dfx common stock in favor of the
asset sale and the dissolution. Approximately 887,313 outstanding shares of
3dfx common stock, or 2.2% of the total number of shares of 3dfx common stock
outstanding on     , 2001, are subject to voting agreements and irrevocable
proxies. The 3dfx executive officers and directors who signed the voting
agreements have also agreed that, before the termination of the voting
agreements, they will not transfer, assign, convey or dispose of any shares of
3dfx common stock, or any option to purchase shares of 3dfx common stock,
owned by them unless each person to whom any shares or options are transferred
executes a voting agreement and agrees to hold those shares or options subject
to all of the terms and provisions of the voting agreement.

   The voting agreements also provide that these directors and executive
officers must vote against the following actions, other than the asset sale or
dissolution:

  . any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation
    or other business combination involving 3dfx;

  . any sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of 3dfx;

  . any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of 3dfx;

  . any change in a majority of the board of directors of 3dfx;

  . any amendment to 3dfx's certificate of incorporation or bylaws;

  .  any material change in the capitalization of 3dfx or 3dfx's corporate
     structure; and

  .  any other action which is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to
     impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect
     the asset sale.

                            OTHER RELATED AGREEMENTS

   The following are descriptions of other agreements entered into by the
parties, and these descriptions set forth what we believe are the material
terms of these agreements. Each of these agreements is attached in Annex D
through Annex H and included as part of this prospectus/proxy statement. You
are urged to read each of these agreements carefully.

Credit Agreement, Security Agreement and Trademark Assignment

   Contemporaneously with the execution of the purchase agreement, NVIDIA US
Investment Company and 3dfx entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which
NVIDIA US Investment Company loaned to 3dfx $15 million. In consideration of
this loan, 3dfx:

  .  granted a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free license to NVIDIA US
     Investment Company for most of the patents, patent applications and
     inventions held by 3dfx pursuant to a patent license agreement,
     described in more detail below; and

  .  assigned and transferred to NVIDIA US Investment Company all trademarks,
     trademark applications, trade names, service marks and service mark
     applications held by 3dfx and its related entities pursuant to a
     trademark assignment.

   In addition, as collateral security for the credit facility, 3dfx granted
NVIDIA US Investment Company a security interest in 3dfx's assets pursuant to a
security agreement. The patent license agreement, trademark assignment
agreement and security agreement were contemporaneously executed with the
credit agreement.

   The loan extended by NVIDIA to 3dfx pursuant to the credit agreement is
repayable by 3dfx at the closing of the asset sale from the cash consideration
received from NVIDIA at closing. In the event of the termination of the
purchase agreement, the loan must be repaid within ten business days; provided
that the outstanding amount due shall be reduced by $10 million in
consideration of 3dfx's assignment of its trademarks and related assets
pursuant to the trademark assignment.

   In connection with the trademark assignment, NVIDIA US Investment Company
agreed to grant 3dfx a license that would allow 3dfx to continue to use its
trademarks and tradenames until the closing or termination of the asset sale.

Patent License Agreement

   Pursuant to the patent license agreement, entered into by NVIDIA, NVIDIA US
Investment Company and 3dfx, 3dfx granted a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-
free license to NVIDIA US Investment Company for most of the patents, patent
applications and inventions held by 3dfx and NVIDIA granted a non-exclusive,
fully-paid, royalty-free license to 3dfx for most of the patents, patent
applications and inventions held by NVIDIA. In conjunction with these license
grants by NVIDIA and 3dfx and pursuant to the terms of this patent license
agreement, 3dfx released NVIDIA and its affiliates from certain claims and
liability relating to those patents held by 3dfx and NVIDIA released 3dfx and
its affiliates from certain claims and liability relating to those patents held
by NVIDIA, in each case, other than those that are the subject of the ongoing
litigation between NVIDIA and 3dfx. In addition, both NVIDIA and 3dfx agreed
not to commence any additional patent infringement litigation against the other
party or its affiliates.

   The patent license agreement went into effect on December 15, 2000, and will
remain in effect unless one of the following occurs:

  .  3dfx and NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company mutually consent to
     terminate the purchase agreement;

                                       76
<PAGE>

  .  either 3dfx or NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company terminates the
     purchase agreement because a court of competent jurisdiction or other
     government body issues a final and nonappealable order permanently
     restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the asset sale;

  .  3dfx terminates the purchase agreement because the closing of the asset
     sale does not occur by May 15, 2001 as a result of the failure of NVIDIA
     or NVIDIA US Investment Company to meet its obligations under the
     purchase agreement;

  .  3dfx elects to terminate the purchase agreement because any of the
     representations and warranties of NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company
     made in the purchase agreement (a) either (i) is inaccurate on the date
     of the purchase agreement or (ii) becomes inaccurate prior to the
     closing of the asset sale, subject to a right to cure such inaccuracies,
     and (b) such inaccuracies in the aggregate constitute a material adverse
     effect on NVIDIA;

  .  3dfx terminates the purchase agreement because NVIDIA or NVIDIA US
     Investment Company fails to comply with or perform in all material
     respects all of its covenants and obligations under the purchase
     agreement required to be complied with or performed at or prior to the
     closing of the asset sale; or

  .  NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company terminates the purchase agreement
     because of an inaccuracy in the representations and warranties made by
     3dfx in the purchase agreement or a breach of the covenants of 3dfx in
     the purchase agreement, but only if such inaccuracy or breach would not
     deprive NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company of the material benefits
     of the purchase agreement.

   In addition, the patent license granted by NVIDIA to 3dfx, and the
accompanying release and covenant not to sue, will terminate if any of the
following events occurs:

  .  there is a change in control of 3dfx;

  .  3dfx dissolves, liquidates or ceases to conduct business;

  .  3dfx admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become
     due, files for bankruptcy, has an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed
     against it or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;

  .  the asset sale closes; or

  .  the purchase agreement terminates for any reason.

   While these events would terminate the license from NVIDIA to 3dfx, they
would not terminate the license from 3dfx to NVIDIA US Investment Company
unless the entire patent license agreement is terminated for one of the reasons
enumerated earlier in this section.

Patent Standstill Agreement

   Under the terms of the patent standstill agreement, NVIDIA and 3dfx agreed
not to bring, file or prosecute any action relating to patents, patent
applications and inventions of either party, other than existing patents in
dispute. In addition, NVIDIA and 3dfx agreed to stay, dismiss with prejudice
and/or seek a continuance of litigation that the parties currently have ongoing
with the other.

   The term of the patent standstill agreement began on December 15, 2000, and
remains effective for three years unless sooner terminated for one of the
following reasons:

  .  3dfx and NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company mutually consent to
     terminate the purchase agreement;

  .  either 3dfx or NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company terminates the
     purchase agreement because a court of competent jurisdiction or other
     government body issues a final and nonappealable order permanently
     restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the asset sale;

                                       77
<PAGE>

  .  3dfx terminates the purchase agreement because the closing of the asset
     sale does not occur by May 15, 2001 as a result of the failure of NVIDIA
     or NVIDIA US Investment Company to meet its obligations under the
     purchase agreement;

  .  3dfx terminates the purchase agreement because any of the
     representations and warranties of NVIDIA or NVIDIA US Investment Company
     made in the purchase agreement (a) either (i) is inaccurate on the date
     of the purchase agreement or (ii) becomes inaccurate prior to the
     closing of the asset sale, subject to a right to cure such inaccuracies,
     and (b) such inaccuracies in the aggregate constitute a material adverse
     effect on NVIDIA; or

  .  3dfx elects to terminate the purchase agreement because NVIDIA or NVIDIA
     US Investment Company fails to comply with or perform in all material
     respects all of its covenants and obligations under the purchase
     agreement required to be complied with or performed at or prior to the
     closing of the asset sale.

   The parties have requested a stay order with respect to their pending
lawsuits against each other in accordance with this agreement and the stay
order was granted on January 5, 2001.

    owned. Applicable percentages are based on 68,099,401 shares of common

    exercisable within 60 days are deemed outstanding. These shares, however,

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary NVIDIA
US Investment Company signed a definitive agreement with 3dfx pursuant to which
NVIDIA US Investment Company agreed to acquire certain of 3dfx's assets,
including its core graphics processor assets.

   Under the terms of the agreement, NVIDIA US Investment Company will pay to
3dfx a total consideration of $70 million in cash and 1,000,000 shares of
NVIDIA common stock. This acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase.

   The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
present financial information giving effect to the acquisition under purchase
accounting. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of
October 29, 2000 is presented as if the purchase had occurred as of that date.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the
nine month period ended October 29, 2000 and the fiscal year ended January 30,
2000 are presented as if the purchase had occurred at the beginning of the
earliest period presented.

   The financial information reflects certain assumptions deemed probable by
NVIDIA management regarding the purchase. The total estimated purchase cost of
the acquisition was allocated on a preliminary basis to assets based upon
management's best estimates of their fair value with the excess cost over the
net assets acquired allocated to goodwill. The adjustments to the unaudited pro
forma combined condensed financial information are subject to change pending a
final analysis of the total purchase cost and the fair value of the assets
assumed. The impact of these changes could be material.

   The pro forma combined condensed financial statements should be read in
conjunction with NVIDIA's unaudited combined condensed financial statements and
notes thereto included in NVIDIA's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended October 29, 2000 and the audited and consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto incorporated by reference in NVIDIA's annual report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2000. The pro forma information is
based on estimates and assumptions and may not necessarily be indicative of
what NVIDIA's results of operations or financial position would have been had
the transaction been in effect as of and for the periods presented, nor is such
information necessarily indicative of NVIDIA's results of operations or
financial position for any future period or date.

     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to
the purchase as if it had occurred on October 29, 2000 with respect to the
balance sheets of NVIDIA and 3dfx.

   On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company signed a
definitive purchase agreement with 3dfx pursuant to which NVIDIA US Investment
Company agreed to acquire certain of 3dfx's assets, including its core
graphics processor assets. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, NVIDIA
US Investment Company will pay to 3dfx a total consideration of $70 million in
cash and 1,000,000 shares of NVIDIA common stock. This purchase of assets will
be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.

   The following adjustments were reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed balance sheet:

  (A) To remove the impact of 3dfx assets not acquired and 3dfx liabilities
      not assumed.

  (B) To record common stock and cash issued to 3dfx and the application of
      purchase accounting. The total purchase price consists of cash of $70
      million and 1,000,000 shares of NVIDIA's common stock with an estimated
      fair value of $40 million and estimated direct transaction costs of
      approximately $6 million. The fair value of NVIDIA's common stock was
      determined as the average market price from December 13, 2000 to
      December 19, 2000, which includes two trading days prior and two
      trading days subsequent to the public announcement of the purchase.

   The amounts and components of the estimated purchase price are presented
below.

<S>                                                              <C>

  Total purchase price..........................................       $116,000
                                                                       ========
</TABLE>

   NVIDIA has assumed that all of 3dfx's debts and liabilities can be
satisfied or paid in full with the total cash consideration of $70 million. If
the debts and liabilities cannot be satisfied, 3dfx could receive a cash
advance from NVIDIA of up to $25 million and this advance would reduce the
number of shares receivable by 3dfx by up to 500,000 shares. Consequently the
components of the estimated purchase price could differ from that presented
above.

   Under purchase accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to
the acquired assets based upon their fair values. Allocations are subject to
valuations as of the date of the completion of the purchase. NVIDIA expects to
allocate the total purchase price to goodwill and other identifiable
intangible and tangible assets. NVIDIA expects to amortize goodwill over five
years and to amortize other identifiable intangible and tangible assets over
their estimated useful lives.

   The actual allocation of the purchase price will depend upon the
composition of 3dfx assets acquired on the closing date and NVIDIA's
evaluation of the fair value of the net assets as of the date indicated.
Consequently, the actual allocation of the purchase price could differ from
that presented above.

Note 2. Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Operations

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations give
effect to the purchase as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest
period presented. The following adjustments have been reflected in the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations:

  (C) Adjustment to remove the 3dfx statements of operations in order to
      reflect only the ongoing impact of assets acquired.

  (D) To record the application of purchase accounting, the amortization of
      goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets and employee-related
      expenses. The pro forma adjustments assume that the purchase price of
      $116 million will be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable
      intangible and tangible assets. The goodwill will be amortized on a
      straight-line basis over five years and the other identifiable
      intangible and tangible assets will be amortized over their estimated
      useful lives. The ultimate lives assigned will be determined at the
      date of closing based on the facts and circumstances existing at that
      date. Employee-related expense includes salaries and benefits for
      former 3dfx employees assumed to be hired by NVIDIA and does not
      include one-time non-recurring bonus expenses of up to $7 million.

  (E) To record the impact of interest expense related to the cash
      consideration of $70 million. For pro forma purposes the source of cash
      was assumed to have been a loan with an interest rate of 4 3/4%.

  (F) To reduce income tax expense for the effect of the pro forma
      adjustments.

  (G) To reflect the estimated shares to be issued as consideration for the
      purchase.

           PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (UNAUDITED)

   The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet of
3dfx as of October 31, 2000 presents the financial position of 3dfx assuming
the asset sale and dissolution of 3dfx had occurred on October 31, 2000. All
material adjustments required to reflect the sale of assets and dissolution are
set forth in the columns labeled "NVIDIA Sale Adjustments" and "Dissolution
Adjustments." The data contained in the column labeled "Historical 3dfx" is
derived from 3dfx's historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of
October 31, 2000.

   The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet of
3dfx should be read in conjunction with the audited historical consolidated
financial statements of 3dfx for the year ended January 31, 2000 (as updated in
3dfx's Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 26, 2001, the audit report on
which contains an explanatory paragraph relating to 3dfx's ability to continue
as a going concern as described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements). The pro forma data is for informational purposes only and may not
necessarily reflect 3dfx's financial position or what 3dfx's financial position
would have been had 3dfx been dissolved on October 31, 2000. There can be no
assurance that the estimated net assets indicated below would be realized if
3dfx were liquidated, wound up and dissolved. 3dfx believes that there is a
likelihood that certain risks related to the liquidation, winding up and
dissolution of 3dfx may result in holders of common stock realizing less than
the estimated net asset value shown in the pro forma condensed consolidated
balance sheet. These risks include, without limitation, the ultimate outcome of
known and unknown claims, litigation, debts and liabilities.

   The valuation of assets and liabilities necessarily requires estimates and
assumptions by management and there are substantial uncertainties in carrying
out any plan of dissolution. The actual value of any liquidating distributions
to 3dfx's shareholders will depend upon a variety of factors including, but not
limited to, the actual net proceeds from the sale of 3dfx's assets (including
those subject to the NVIDIA asset sale), the ultimate settlement amounts of
3dfx's liabilities and obligations (including the settlement of known and
unknown claims or litigation), actual costs incurred in connection with
carrying out the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx, including
costs of liquidation and establishing reserves, and the actual timing of the
final dissolution of 3dfx. The asset values and liability settlements
ultimately realized in the liquidation, winding up and dissolution of 3dfx
could materially differ from the amounts shown in the pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheet below. No assurance can be given that the amount of
any liquidating distributions to 3dfx shareholders will equal the estimated
amounts included in the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet below.

   No pro forma statement of operations data has been presented due to 3dfx's
intention to liquidate, wind up and dissolve.

Note 1. Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet

   The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet gives effect to the asset
sale and dissolution of 3dfx as if they had occurred on October 31, 2000.

Asset Sale

   On December 15, 2000, 3dfx entered into a definitive purchase agreement with
NVIDIA and NVIDIA US Investment Company pursuant to which NVIDIA US Investment
Company will acquire some of the assets of

                                       90
<PAGE>

3dfx, including its core graphics processor assets. Under the terms of the
purchase agreement, NVIDIA US Investment Company has agreed to pay 3dfx $70
million in cash and one million shares of NVIDIA common stock. Upon signing
the purchase agreement, NVIDIA US Investment Company loaned to 3dfx $15
million for working capital, which will be repaid from the cash portion of the
purchase price at closing. In addition, upon signing the purchase agreement,
3dfx transferred to NVIDIA US Investment Company its "3dfx," "Voodoo" and
other trademarks and both 3dfx and NVIDIA agreed to stay the patent
infringement litigation between them through closing of the transaction, at
which time it will be jointly dismissed. The closing of the transaction is
subject to a variety of conditions, including 3dfx shareholder approval,
receipt of governmental approval including approval under the HSR Act, and
receipt of all necessary consents of third parties. There is no assurance that
3dfx can successfully consummate the sale of its assets, secure additional
financing or otherwise increase its liquidity. 3dfx may seek the protection of
state insolvency or federal bankruptcy law for the orderly liquidation of its
assets, or the same may be imposed upon 3dfx by its creditors.

Plan of Dissolution

   On December 15, 2000, the board of directors of 3dfx approved a plan of
dissolution and is recommending that its shareholders also approve the plan of
dissolution. Assuming 3dfx's shareholders approve the plan of dissolution and
the asset sale, 3dfx intends to then close the asset sale and otherwise wind
up its affairs. The proceeds from the asset sale and the sale of 3dfx's
remaining assets will be used to pay or adequately provide for 3dfx's and its
subsidiaries' debts and liabilities. Any remaining assets will thereafter be
distributed to 3dfx's shareholders in one or more distributions, and 3dfx will
then dissolve.

   The following adjustments are reflected in the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated balance sheet:

  (A) To record cash and NVIDIA common stock received. The total sale price
      of approximately $115 million consists of cash of $95 million and
      500,000 shares of NVIDIA common stock with an estimated fair value of
      $20 million, assuming 3dfx receives $25 million in advances from nVidia
      following the close of the sale. The fair value of NVIDIA common stock
      was determined as the average market price from December 13, 2000 to
      December 19, 2000, which included two days prior and two days
      subsequent to the public announcement of the sale.

  (B) To record adjustments to state net assets at estimated liquidation
      value.

  (C) To record accrual for estimated costs of liquidation and dissolution,
      which include severance payments to employees of $22 million and other
      liabilities of $25.2 million.

        COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF NVIDIA STOCKHOLDERS AND 3DFX SHAREHOLDERS

   NVIDIA is a Delaware corporation governed by the Delaware General
Corporation Law. 3dfx is a California corporation governed by the California
Corporations Code. The rights of NVIDIA stockholders are governed by NVIDIA's
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the bylaws, as amended,
and the rights of 3dfx shareholders are governed by 3dfx's amended and restated
articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended. The following is a summary of
some of the rights of NVIDIA stockholders and 3dfx shareholders, which is
provided in light of the possibility that 3dfx may distribute to its
shareholders shares of NVIDIA common stock in connection with the dissolution
of 3dfx. This summary does not purport to be a complete discussion of, and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to, Delaware law and California law as
well as to NVIDIA's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, NVIDIA's
bylaws, as amended, 3dfx's amended and restated articles of incorporation and
3dfx's bylaws, as amended.

Authorized Capital Stock

   3dfx. The authorized capital stock of 3dfx consists of 50,000,000 shares of
common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

   NVIDIA. The authorized capital stock of NVIDIA consists of 200,000,000
shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

Number of Directors

   3dfx. 3dfx's board of directors currently consists of five members.

   NVIDIA. NVIDIA's board of directors currently consists of seven members.

Changes in the Number of Directors

   3dfx. 3dfx's bylaws provide that the exact number of directors is to be
seven until changed, within a range of five to nine, by a bylaw duly adopted by
the board of directors or by the shareholders. An amendment reducing the
minimum number of directors to a number less than five cannot be adopted if the
votes cast against its adoption at a meeting, or the shares not consenting in
the case of an action by written consent, are equal to more than 16 2/3% of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment. No amendment may change
the stated maximum number of authorized directors to a number greater than two
times the stated minimum number of directors minus one. No reduction of the
authorized number of directors has the effect of removing any director before
the director's term of office expires. Any director may resign effective upon
giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the
secretary or the board of directors of the corporation, unless the notice
specifies a later time for the effectiveness of the resignation. If the board
of directors accepts the resignation of a director tendered to take effect at a
future time, the board or the shareholders have the power to elect a successor
to take office when the resignation is to become effective.

   NVIDIA. NVIDIA's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws as amended provide that the setting of the authorized number of
directors and any changes to the authorized number of directors may be effected
only by resolution of the board of directors. NVIDIA's bylaws as amended
further provide that no decrease in the number of directors shall have the
effect of shortening the term of an incumbent director.

Election of Directors

   3dfx. 3dfx's bylaws provide that members of the 3dfx board of directors are
to be elected at each annual meeting of shareholders, but if an annual meeting
is not held, or the directors are not elected at an annual meeting, the
directors may be elected at any special meeting of shareholders held for that
purpose. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, holds
office until his successor is elected, except as otherwise provided by the
California Corporations Code.

                                       92
<PAGE>

   NVIDIA. All members of the NVIDIA board of directors serve on a staggered
board that is divided into three classes, with each class serving a three-year
term. As a result, a portion of the board of directors is elected each year by
a majority vote of outstanding stockholders.

Removal of Directors

   3dfx. Under the California Corporations Code, any or all of 3dfx's directors
may be removed with or without cause if the removal is approved by a majority
of the shares entitled to vote, subject to some exceptions for (i) a
corporation having a classified board of directors, (ii) the entitlement of
some classes or series of shares to elect a director voting as a class or
series, or (iii) by order of a court pursuant to the applicable provisions of
the California Corporations Code. However, no single director may be removed
unless the entire board of directors is removed if the votes cast against the
removal of the single director would be sufficient to elect that director if
voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were
cast and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the
director's most recent election were being elected. Shareholders holding at
least 10% of the outstanding shares in any class may sue in superior county
court to remove from office any officer or director for fraud, dishonest acts
or gross abuse of authority or discretion.

   NVIDIA. NVIDIA's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws state that a director may be removed with cause by the holders of a
majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors or
without cause by a vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of voting stock of
the corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors.

Special Meeting of Shareholders

   3dfx. Under the California Corporations Code and the 3dfx bylaws, as
amended, a special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the board of
directors, the chairman of the board, the president, the holders of shares
entitled to cast not less than 10% of the votes at the meeting or any
additional persons as may be designated in the corporation's articles of
incorporation or bylaws. 3dfx's bylaws, as amended, state that special meetings
of the shareholders, for purposes consistent with the California Corporations
Code, may be called at any time by the Board or the Chairman of the Board, and
by the President or one or more shareholders holding not less than 10% of the
votes entitled to be cast at the meeting if certain notice requirements are
satisfied.

   NVIDIA. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a special meeting of
stockholders may be called by the board of directors or any other person
authorized to do so in the corporation's certificate of incorporation or
bylaws. NVIDIA's bylaws as amended state that a special meeting of
stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by the chairman of the
board of directors, the chief executive officer or the board of directors
pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of
authorized directors whether or not board vacancies in previously authorized
directorships exist.

Action by Written Consent of Shareholders

   3dfx. 3dfx's bylaws, as amended, allow any action requiring shareholder
approval to be taken without a meeting, and without notice, if a consent in
writing setting forth the action taken is signed by the holders of the
outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to take the action at a shareholders' meeting.

   NVIDIA. NVIDIA's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides
that any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders must be
effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not
be effected by written consent.

Amendments to Bylaws

   3dfx. The California Corporations Code states that a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote or the board of directors may amend the
bylaws of a corporation, unless prohibited from doing so by the corporation's
articles of incorporation or bylaws. The 3dfx bylaws, as amended, allow an
amendment by the board of directors, unless the amendment would change the
authorized maximum or minimum number of directors.

   NVIDIA. The Delaware General Corporation Law states that stockholders
entitled to vote have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of a
corporation. A corporation, in its certificate, may also confer this power on
the board of directors in addition to the stockholders. NVIDIA's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws confer the power to adopt,
amend or repeal bylaws upon the board of directors. NVIDIA's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as amended also provide that
the bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66
2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock.

Voting Stock

   3dfx. The outstanding voting stock of 3dfx consists solely of common stock
of 3dfx.

   NVIDIA. The outstanding voting stock of NVIDIA consists solely of common
stock of NVIDIA.

Shareholder Rights Plan

   3dfx. 3dfx has adopted a shareholder rights plan that, among other things,
discourages some types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened
change of control of 3dfx. Holders of shares of 3dfx common stock issued and
outstanding are entitled to purchase one-thousandth of a share of 3dfx's
preferred stock. The purchase right is exercisable upon the acquisition of, or
the notification of an intent to acquire, a beneficial ownership of 12% or more
of 3dfx's outstanding common stock. Although the asset sale does not trigger
the purchase right in any event, the asset sale was specifically exempted from
the provisions of the shareholder rights plan through a clarifying amendment to
the shareholder rights plan executed by 3dfx and Fleet National Bank in
December 2000.

   NVIDIA. NVIDIA does not currently have a stockholder rights plan.

Issuance of Additional Stock

   3dfx. Subject to limitations prescribed by California law, 3dfx's board of
directors has the authority to issue up to 5 million shares of preferred stock
and up to a total of 50 million shares of common stock of 3dfx (including
shares of common stock of 3dfx currently issued and outstanding). 3dfx's board
of directors have fixed the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of
60,000 of the unissued preferred shares, designating them as Series A
Participating Preferred Stock.

   NVIDIA. Subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, NVIDIA's board of
directors has the authority to issue up to 2 million shares of preferred stock
and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of those shares and
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any wholly unissued shares,
and to issue up to a total of 200 million shares of common stock of NVIDIA
(including shares of common stock of NVIDIA currently issued and outstanding).

Preemptive Rights

   3dfx. Neither 3dfx's amended and restated articles of incorporation nor its
bylaws, as amended, contain any provisions relating to preemptive rights.

   NVIDIA. NVIDIA's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws do not contain any provisions relating to preemptive rights.

Compliance with California Law

   3dfx. 3dfx is a California corporation governed by the California
Corporations Code.

   NVIDIA. NVIDIA is a Delaware corporation and is not subject to California
corporate law under Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code.

                              PLAN OF DISSOLUTION

   This Plan of Dissolution (this "Plan") is for the purpose of effecting the
complete liquidation and dissolution of 3dfx Interactive, Inc., a California
corporation (the "Company").

   1. Approval of this Plan. In accordance with Section 1900(a) of the
California Corporations Code, this Plan shall be submitted to the shareholders
of the Company for approval at the Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held
for that purpose. This Plan shall become effective and voluntary proceedings
for winding up shall commence on such date, after the approval of the holders
of a majority of the Company's outstanding shares of stock, as the Board of
Directors (the "Board") may designate (the "Effective Date").

   2. Consummation of the Purchase Agreement Transaction; Cessation of
Business. Following the effectiveness of this Plan, and in the event the
Company's shareholders approve the transaction (the "Asset Sale") contemplated
by that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of December 15, 2000, between
the Company, nVidia Corporation and a subsidiary of nVidia Corporation (as it
may be amended, the "Purchase Agreement"), the Company shall consummate the
Asset Sale, and then continue with its winding up pursuant to this Plan and
shall not engage in any further business activities, except for the purpose of
managing its investments in cash, cash equivalents and other marketable
securities, completing work in process, disposing of its assets, providing for
satisfaction of its obligations, adjusting and winding up its business and
affairs, and distributing the proceeds from the disposition of its assets in
accordance with this Plan. The Board then in office shall continue in office
solely for that purpose. The Board shall dissolve the Company as soon as it
deems feasible.

   3. Continuing Employees and Consultants. For the purpose of effecting the
liquidation of the Company's assets, the Company shall hire or retain, at the
discretion of the Board, such employees and consultants as the Board deems
necessary or advisable to supervise the liquidation.

   4. Expenses of Liquidation. The Board shall provide, from the assets of the
Company, reasonable funds for payment of the expenses of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Company, including filing fees and other expenses relating
to the holding of the Special Meeting of Shareholders to consider this Plan and
other documentation required in connection with this Plan, continuation of
employees and/or consultants engaged in the liquidation process, accountants'
and attorneys' fees and expenses, and other reasonable fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the liquidation process.

   5. Payment of Legally Enforceable Claims. The Company shall satisfy, or
adequately provide for the satisfaction of, all its legally enforceable debts
and liabilities in an orderly manner (as well as the debts and liabilities of
its subsidiaries that are legally enforceable against the Company or which in
the opinion of the board should be paid or provided for in order to maximize
assets ultimately available to the Company's shareholders).

   6. Provision for Continued Indemnification of Board and Officers. The
Company may reserve sufficient assets and/or obtain and maintain such insurance
as shall be necessary to provide for continued indemnification of the members
of the Board, officers and agents of the Company, and other parties whom the
Company has agreed to indemnify, to the full extent provided by the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company, any existing indemnification
agreements between the Company and any of such persons, and applicable law. At
the discretion of the Board, such insurance may include coverage for periods
after the dissolution of the Company, including periods after the termination
of any Liquidating Trust (as defined below), and may include coverage for
trustees, employees and agents of such Liquidating Trust.

                                      A-1
<PAGE>

   7. Distributions to Shareholders. After paying or adequately providing for
the expenses of liquidation and lawful debts and liabilities and reserving
sufficient assets and/or obtaining insurance as set forth in Section 6, the
Board is authorized to make a distribution to shareholders from the proceeds of
the Asset Sale. Any remaining assets will thereafter be distributed to the
shareholders of the Company in accordance with their respective shareholdings.

   8. Liquidating Trust. If it is deemed advisable by the Board for any reason,
the Board may cause the Company to create a liquidating trust (the "Liquidating
Trust") and to distribute beneficial interests in the Liquidating Trust to the
shareholders as part of the liquidation process. The Liquidating Trust shall be
constituted pursuant to a liquidating trust agreement in such form as the Board
may approve, it being intended that the transfer and assignment to the
Liquidating Trust pursuant hereto and the distribution to shareholders of the
beneficial interests therein shall constitute a part of the final liquidating
distribution by the Company to the shareholders of their pro rata interests in
the remaining amount of cash and other property held by or for the account of
the Company. From and after the date of the Company's transfer of cash and
property to the Liquidating Trust, the Company shall have no interest of any
character in and to any such cash and property and all of such cash and
property shall thereafter be held by the Liquidating Trust solely for the
benefit of and ultimate distribution to the shareholders, subject to any
unsatisfied debts, liabilities and expenses.

   9. Authorization. The Board or the trustees of the Liquidating Trust, and
such officers of the Company as the Board may direct shall have the powers and
duties specified in Section 2001 of the California Corporations Code and are
hereby authorized to interpret the provisions of this Plan and are hereby
authorized and directed to take such further actions, to execute such
agreements, conveyances, assignments, transfers, certificates and other
documents, as may in their judgment be necessary or desirable in order to wind
up expeditiously the affairs of the Company and complete the liquidation
thereof, including, without limitation, (i) the execution of any contracts,
deeds, assignments or other instruments necessary or appropriate to sell or
otherwise dispose of, any and all property of the Company remaining after the
consummation of the Asset Sale, whether real or personal, tangible or
intangible, (ii) the appointment of other persons to carry out any aspect of
this Plan, (iii) the temporary investment of funds in such medium as the Board
may deem appropriate, and (iv) the modification of this Plan as may be
necessary to implement this Plan. The death, resignation or other disability of
any director or officer of the Company shall not impair the authority of the
surviving or remaining directors or officers of the Company (or any persons
appointed as substitutes therefor) to exercise any of the powers provided for
in this Plan. Upon such death, resignation or other disability, the surviving
or remaining directors shall have the authority to fill the vacancy or
vacancies so created, but the failure to fill such vacancy or vacancies shall
not impair the authority of the surviving or remaining directors or officers to
exercise any of the powers provided for in this Plan.

   10. Amendment or Delay of Implementation of this Plan. The Board may, by
vote of the majority of the Board then in office, amend this Plan or delay the
implementation of this Plan, whether or not a vote of the shareholders has
previously occurred, unless the Board determines that such amendment or delay
would materially and adversely affect the shareholders' interests.

                            ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

   This Asset Purchase Agreement is entered into as of December 15, 2000, by
and among 3dfx Interactive, Inc. a California corporation (the "Seller"), and
NVIDIA Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent") and Titan Acquisition
Corp. No. 2, a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (the "Purchaser"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in Exhibit A.

                                    Recitals

   A. Parent, the Purchaser and the Seller wish to provide for the sale by the
Seller to the Purchaser of the Specified Assets (as defined in Section 1.1),
the stay and ultimate settlement of certain patent infringement litigation
between Parent and the Seller, and certain other related transactions among the
parties, all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

   B. In order to induce Parent and the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain shareholders of the
Seller are entering into Voting Agreements and related proxies in favor of
Parent and the Purchaser (the "Voting Agreements").

   C. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Seller and the Purchaser are entering into a Credit Agreement (as defined in
Section 1.5) pursuant to which the Purchaser is providing a $15 million credit
facility to the Seller.

   D. The board of directors of the Seller has adopted a plan of dissolution
("Plan of Dissolution") which contemplates that the Seller will, subject to the
approval of its shareholders at the Shareholders' Meeting (as defined herein),
elect voluntarily to wind up and dissolve pursuant to the California
Corporations Code.

                                   Agreement

   The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

1. Sale of Specified Assets; Related Transactions.

   1.1 Sale of Specified Assets. The Seller shall cause to be sold, assigned,
transferred, conveyed and delivered to the Purchaser, at the Closing (as
defined in Section 1.9), good and valid title to the Specified Assets (as
defined below), free and clear of any Encumbrances, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Specified Assets" shall mean and include all of the properties, rights,
interests and other tangible and intangible assets (wherever located and
whether or not required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP), including any such assets acquired by the Seller
Corporations during the Pre-Closing Period, that are or were used in, needed
for the conduct of or material to, or that otherwise directly or indirectly
relate to, the graphics business of the Seller Corporations (the "Graphics
Business"); provided, however, that the Specified Assets shall not include any
Excluded Assets. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Specified Assets shall include the following:

     (a) Patents and Patent Applications; Trademarks: All of the patents,
  patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, trade names,
  service marks and service mark applications of the Seller Corporations,
  including those identified on Exhibit B, and any counterparts, reissues,
  extensions, continuations and continuations in part related to the
  foregoing;

     (b) Other Proprietary Assets: All Proprietary Assets and goodwill of the
  Seller Corporations (including the right to use the names "3dfx," "Voodoo,"
  "GigaPixel Corporation," "STB Systems,"

                                      B-1
<PAGE>

  "STB Assembly" and "Symmetric Simulation Systems" and variations thereof,
  and the Proprietary Assets identified in Part 2.10 of the Disclosure
  Schedule), all of the copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, computer
  software, inventions, designs, drawings, existing and in-development chip
  designs and related specifications, source codes, verification and
  validation environments, manufacturing specifications and databases, in
  process research and development, product reviews and other Proprietary
  Assets identified on Exhibit B;

     (c) Inventory; Equipment; Other Tangible Assets: The inventories
  (including raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods), equipment,
  materials, prototypes, tools, supplies, vehicles, furniture, fixtures,
  improvements and other tangible assets of the Seller Corporations
  identified on Exhibit B, including the tangible assets identified in Part
  2.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, the entire inventory of graphics chips of
  the Seller Corporations as of the date hereof and all advertising and
  promotional materials of the Seller Corporations relating to its Graphics
  Business;

     (d) Contracts: All rights of the Seller Corporations under the Seller
  Contracts (including the Seller Contracts identified in Part 2.11 of the
  Disclosure Schedule) relating to the Graphics Business;

     (e) Governmental Authorizations: All Governmental Authorizations held by
  the Seller Corporations (including the Governmental Authorizations
  identified in Part 2.14 of the Disclosure Schedule) relating to the
  Graphics Business;

     (f) Claims: All claims (including claims for past infringement of
  Proprietary Assets) and causes of action of the Seller Corporations against
  other Persons relating to the Graphics Business (regardless of whether or
  not such claims and causes of action have been asserted by the Seller
  Corporations), and all rights of indemnity, warranty rights, rights of
  contribution, rights to refunds, rights of reimbursement and other rights
  of recovery possessed by the Seller Corporations relating to the Graphics
  Business (regardless of whether such rights are currently exercisable);

     (g) Other Assets: All of the Seller Corporations' existing and in-
  development chip designs and related specifications, source codes,
  verification and validation environments, manufacturing specifications and
  databases and customer lists;

     (h) Books and Records: All books, records, files and data of the Seller
  Corporations relating directly or indirectly to the Graphics Business; and

     (i) Proceeds: Without limiting any restriction contained herein on any
  such sale or other disposition, an amount of cash and receivables equal to
  the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any of the
  foregoing after the date hereof.

   1.2 Consideration. As consideration for the sale of the Specified Assets to
the Purchaser, the Purchaser has agreed (a) to pay to the Seller at the Closing
(as defined herein) cash in the amount of $70,000,000 (the "Cash
Consideration"), (b) subject to Section 1.3, to deliver to the Seller (but only
upon and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1.3, and subject to
adjustment as provided therein) one million shares of the common stock, par
value $.001 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), of Parent (the "Stock
Consideration"), and (c) to assume at the Closing the Designated Contractual
Obligations (as defined in Section 1.4(b)) of the Seller by entering into with
the Seller (and, if applicable, other Seller Corporations) an Assignment and
Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit D (the "Assignment
and Assumption Agreement").

   1.3 Payment of Stock Consideration; Adjustment.

     (a) The Stock Consideration will be issued by Parent promptly following
  the Closing and contributed by Parent to the Purchaser, but shall only
  become deliverable by the Purchaser to the Seller upon and subject to the
  completion of the winding up of the business of the Seller pursuant to the
  Plan of Dissolution, and delivery to the Purchaser of a certificate
  executed by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the
  Seller certifying that the shareholders of the Seller have duly adopted
  resolutions

                                      B-2
<PAGE>

  approving the wind-up and dissolution of the Seller pursuant to the
  California Corporations Code, that all Liabilities of the Seller
  Corporations have been paid in full or otherwise provided for (in a manner
  satisfactory to the Purchaser) from sources other than the Stock
  Consideration and that the Seller has been validly dissolved (or will upon
  the filing of a Certificate of Dissolution and subject to no other
  conditions be dissolved) under the California Corporations Code.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will any portion of the Stock
  Consideration become payable unless and until the Purchaser is satisfied
  that the Seller shall have first paid in full or otherwise provided for (in
  a manner satisfactory to the Purchaser) all Liabilities of the Seller
  Corporations that are not included among the Designated Contractual
  Obligations (as defined below).

     (b) Following and subject to the Closing, and prior to any payment to
  the Seller of the Stock Consideration, in the event that the Seller is not
  in breach of this Agreement (excluding Section 2.29 for purposes of the
  foregoing), has expended all or substantially all of the Cash Consideration
  in payment of Liabilities of the Seller Corporations, and reasonably and in
  good faith determines (i) that the then-remaining Cash Consideration is or
  will be insufficient to enable the Seller Corporations to pay in full all
  then-remaining Liabilities of the Seller Corporations, and (ii) that all
  then-remaining Liabilities of the Seller Corporations could and would be
  paid in full if Seller had access to additional funds in an amount not in
  excess of $25,000,000 and applied such funds exclusively to the payment of
  such Liabilities, the Seller shall be entitled to request in writing that
  the Purchaser advance to the Seller up to a maximum of $25,000,000 (the
  "Post-Closing Advance"). Subject to the foregoing conditions, the Purchaser
  shall be obligated to make the Post-Closing Advance, within ten business
  days after receipt of such written request, unless it determines in good
  faith that the funds requested would not permit the Seller to pay in full
  all then-remaining Liabilities of the Seller Corporations. A maximum of one
  Post-Closing Advance shall ever be required to be made by the Purchaser. In
  the event that the Purchaser makes a Post-Closing Advance to the Seller,
  the number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock
  Consideration shall be reduced automatically (and without any action on the
  part of any party) by the number of shares equal to the quotient determined
  by dividing (1) the amount of the Post-Closing Advance by (2) $50.00.

     (c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which the
  Stock Consideration (or any portion thereof) is issued to the Seller, the
  outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are changed into a different
  number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
  subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation
  of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction,
  then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock
  Consideration, and the dollar amount set forth in clause (2) of the last
  sentence of Section 1.3(b), shall be appropriately adjusted.

   1.4 No Assumed Liabilities.

     (a) Subject to Section 1.4(b), neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall
  assume any Liabilities of the Seller whatsoever, whether relating to the
  Specified Assets, the Graphics Business or otherwise.

     (b) Notwithstanding Section 1.4(a), pursuant to the Assignment and
  Assumption Agreement, at and following the Closing the Purchaser will
  become obligated to perform the obligations of the Seller under any Assumed
  Contracts, but only to the extent such obligations: (i) arise after the
  Closing Date; (ii) do not arise from or relate to any Breach by the Seller
  of any provision of any of the Assumed Contracts; (iii) do not arise from
  or relate to any event, circumstance or condition occurring or existing on
  or prior to the Closing Date that, with notice or lapse of time, would
  constitute or result in a Breach of any of the Assumed Contracts; and (iv)
  are ascertainable (in nature and amount) solely by reference to the express
  terms of the Assumed Contracts (the "Designated Contractual Obligations");
  provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding
  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the "Designated
  Contractual Obligations" shall not include, and neither Parent nor the
  Purchaser shall be required to assume or to perform or discharge:

       (1) any Liability of any Person under the Assumed Contracts, except
    for the Seller Corporations;


                                      B-3
<PAGE>

       (2) any Liability of the Seller Corporations arising from or
    relating to any action taken by the Seller Corporations, or any failure
    on the part of the Seller Corporations to take any action, at any time
    prior to the Closing Date;

       (3) any Liability of the Seller Corporations for the payment of any
    Tax;

       (4) any Liability of the Seller Corporations to any employee or
    former employee of the Seller Corporations under the WARN Act, or under
    or with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, profit sharing plan or
    dental plan or for severance pay, or for accrued vacation pay or wages;

       (4) any Liability of the Seller Corporations to any Related Party;

       (5) any Liability under any Assumed Contract, if the Seller shall
    not have obtained, prior to the Closing Date, any Consent required to
    be obtained from any Person with respect to the assignment or
    delegation to the Purchaser of any rights or obligations under such
    Assumed Contract;

       (6) any Liability that is inconsistent with or constitutes an
    inaccuracy in, or that arises or exists by virtue of any Breach of, (x)
    any representation or warranty made by the Seller in any of the
    Transactional Agreements, or (y) any covenant or obligation of the
    Seller contained in any of the Transactional Agreements; or

       (7) any other Liability of the Seller Corporations not expressly
    assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of any of the
    Transactional Agreements.

   1.5 Credit Facility. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller are entering into a Credit
Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") pursuant to which the Purchaser is providing
the Seller with immediate borrowing availability in the amount of $15,000,000
(the "Credit Facility"). In consideration of the execution of the Credit
Agreement and the establishment of the Credit Facility, (a) the Seller is
granting to the Purchaser a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully-paid license for
all of the Seller's patents, patent applications and inventions, which are held
by Seller free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than as may be asserted by
virtue of the Parent Pending Litigation), pursuant to a patent license
agreement (the "Patent License Agreement") of even date herewith, and (b) the
Seller is causing to be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered to
the Purchaser good and valid title, free and clear of any Encumbrances, to all
of the trademarks, trademark applications, trade names, service marks and
service mark applications of the Seller Corporations.

   1.6 Stay Order; Standstill Agreement.

     (a) Contemporaneously with the execution hereof, the Seller has agreed
  to stay the Seller Pending Litigation, and Parent has agreed to stay the
  Parent Pending Litigation, pursuant to and by executing and filing with the
  court the Stay Order.

     (b) Contemporaneously with the execution hereof, the Seller and Parent
  have agreed to refrain from bringing litigation against the other with
  respect to certain patents, patent applications and inventions, pursuant to
  the Patent Standstill Agreement.

   1.7 Taxes. The Seller shall bear and pay, and shall reimburse the Purchaser
and the Purchaser's affiliates for, any sales taxes, use taxes, transfer taxes,
income taxes, documentary charges, filing fees, recording fees or similar
taxes, charges, fees or expenses that may become payable in connection with the
sale of the Specified Assets to the Purchaser or in connection with any of the
other Transactions. The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser to file all
requests for certifications of sales and use tax due, including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 6812 of the California Revenue and Taxation
Code.

   1.8 Allocation. At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to
the Seller a statement setting forth the Purchaser's good faith determination
of the manner in which the consideration referred to in Section 1.2 is to be
allocated among the Specified Assets. The allocation prescribed by such
statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the Seller for all purposes. The
Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge that the

                                      B-4
<PAGE>

Transactions do not constitute a reorganization described in Section 368 of the
Code. The Seller shall not file any Tax Return or other document with, or make
any statement or declaration to, any Governmental Body that is inconsistent
with such allocation or that is inconsistent with the Transactions not
constituting a reorganization.

   1.9 Closing.

     (a) The closing of the sale of the Specified Assets and the other
  Transactions to be consummated contemporaneously therewith to the Purchaser
  (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward llp in
  Palo Alto, California, at 10:00 a.m. on such date (after the expiration of
  the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the satisfaction or
  waiver of the other conditions to the Closing set forth herein) as the
  Purchaser may designate in a written notice delivered to the Seller;
  provided, however, that if any condition set forth in Section 6 has not
  been satisfied as of the date designated by the Purchaser, then the
  Purchaser may, at its election, unilaterally postpone the Closing to such
  other date prior to the Termination Date as it reasonably deems
  appropriate.

     (b) At the Closing, without limiting any of the conditions to the
  Closing set forth in Section 6 or Section 7:

       (i) the Seller shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be
    executed and delivered, to the Purchaser such bills of sale,
    endorsements, assignments (including patent assignments) and other
    documents as may (in the reasonable judgment of the Purchaser or its
    counsel) be necessary or appropriate to assign, convey, transfer and
    deliver to the Purchaser good and valid title to the Specified Assets
    free of any Encumbrances;

       (ii) the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the Cash Consideration,
    subject to Section 4.8, and provided that the Purchaser will be entitled
    to set off, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, against the
    Cash Consideration any amount outstanding under the Credit Facility at
    the Closing;

       (iii) the parties hereto shall execute and deliver the Assignment and
    Assumption Agreement;

       (iv) the Seller shall execute and deliver to Parent and the Purchaser
    a certificate (the "Seller Closing Certificate"), executed by the Chief
    Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Seller,
    certifying that (A) each of the representations and warranties made by
    the Seller in this Agreement was accurate in all material respects as of
    the date of this Agreement, (B) except as expressly set forth in the
    Seller Closing Certificate, each of the representations and warranties
    made by the Seller in this Agreement is accurate in all material
    respects as of the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date, (C) each
    of the covenants and obligations that the Seller is required to have
    complied with or performed pursuant to this Agreement at or prior to the
    Closing has been duly complied with and performed in all material
    respects, and (D) except as expressly set forth in the Seller Closing
    Certificate, each of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.3 and 6.4
    has been satisfied in all material respects;

       (v) the Purchaser and Parent shall execute and deliver to the Seller
    a certificate (the "Purchaser Closing Certificate"), executed by the

  program or software accepts and responds to year input in a manner that
  resolves any ambiguities as to century in a defined, predetermined and
  appropriate manner; and (iii) such program or software determines leap

Seller Corporations to comply with, any material Legal Requirement applicable
to them; and (d) the Seller Corporations have not received, at any time, any
notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise) from any Governmental
Body or any other Person regarding (i) any actual, alleged, possible or

  and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of
  interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition

  agreement at the request of Parent or the Purchaser. The Seller also will

  written advice of the Seller's outside legal counsel, that, in light of
  such Superior Offer, and taking into account any offer made by Parent or

  modification of the Seller Board Recommendation is required in order for
  the Seller's board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to

    Seller;

       (b) by either Parent and the Purchaser or the Seller if the
    Transactions shall not have been consummated by May 15, 2001 (the
    "Termination Date"); provided, however, that (i) a party shall not be
    permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)
    if the failure to consummate the Transactions by the Termination Date
    is attributable to a failure on the part of such party to perform any
    covenant in this Agreement required to be performed by such party at or
    prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) the Seller shall not be permitted
    to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) unless the
    Seller shall have made any payment required to be made to the Purchaser
    pursuant to Section 8.4(a) and shall have paid to the Purchaser any fee
    required to be paid to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.4(c);

       (c) by either Parent and the Purchaser or the Seller if a court of

    any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining,
    enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions;

       (d) by either Parent and the Purchaser or the Seller if (i) the
    Shareholders' Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements
    thereof) shall have been held and completed and the Seller's
    shareholders shall have taken a final vote on a proposal to approve the
    Acquisition and the Plan of Dissolution, and (ii) the Acquisition and
    the Plan of Dissolution shall not both have been approved at the
    Shareholders' Meeting (or at any adjournment or postponement thereof)
    by the Required Shareholder Vote; provided, however, that (A) a party
    shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
    Section 8.1(d) if the failure to have the Acquisition and the Plan of
    Dissolution approved by the Required Shareholder Vote is attributable
    to a failure on the part of such party to perform any covenant in this
    Agreement required to be performed by such party at or prior to the
    Closing Date, and (B) the Seller shall not be permitted to terminate
    this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) unless the Seller shall

    Section 8.4(a) and shall have paid to the Purchaser the fee required to

       (f) by Parent and the Purchaser if (i) any of the Seller's
    representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
    inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, or shall have become
    inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if
    made on such subsequent date), such that the condition set forth in
    Section 6.1 would not be satisfied (it being understood that, for
    purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and
    warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent
    date, any update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or
    purported to have been made after the date of this Agreement shall be
    disregarded), or (ii) any of the Seller's covenants contained in this
    Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in
    Section 6.2 would not be satisfied; provided, however, that if an
    inaccuracy in any of the Seller's representations and warranties as of
    a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a
    covenant by the Seller is curable by the Seller and the Seller is
    continuing to exercise all reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy
    or breach, then Parent and the

                                      B-29
<PAGE>

    Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) on
    account of such inaccuracy or breach; or

       (g) by the Seller if (i) any of the representations and warranties
    of Parent and the Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall be
    inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, or shall have become
    inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if
    made on such subsequent date), such that the condition set forth in
    Section 7.1 would not be satisfied, or (ii) if any of the covenants of
    Parent and the Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall have been
    breached such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2 would not be
    satisfied; provided, however, that if an inaccuracy in any of the
    representations and warranties of Parent and the Purchaser as of a date
    subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant by
    Parent or the Purchaser is curable by Parent or the Purchaser and
    Parent or the Purchaser is continuing to exercise all reasonable
    efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then the Seller may not
    terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(g) on account of such
    inaccuracy or breach.

   8.2 Termination Procedures. If Parent and the Purchaser wishes to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a), Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(c),
Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(f), Parent and the Purchaser shall deliver to the

       (a) Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement or in
    any of the other Transactional Agreements, and subject to Section
    8.3(b), if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, all
    further obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall
    terminate; provided, however, that: (a) no party shall be relieved of
    any obligation or other Liability arising from any Breach by such party
    of any provision of this Agreement; and (b) the parties shall, in all
    events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to the provisions
    set forth in Section 11 that continue pursuant to their terms.

       (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of
    Section 8.1, other than (i) by the parties pursuant to Section 8.1(a),
    (ii) by the Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(b) by reason of the failure
    of the Closing to occur by the date set forth therein solely as a
    result of the failure of Parent or the Purchaser to comply with its
    obligations under this Agreement, (iii) by the parties pursuant to
    Section 8.1(c), or (iv) by the Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then
    immediately upon such termination Parent shall dismiss with prejudice
    the Parent Pending Litigation and the Seller shall dismiss with
    prejudice the Seller Pending Litigation, each by executing and filing
    with the court the Stipulation and Proposed Order to Dismiss with
    Prejudice in substantially the form of Exhibit F.

     (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.4, all fees and expenses
  incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
  contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
  expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated; provided,
  however, that:

       (i) Parent and the Purchaser (on the one hand) and the Seller (on
    the other hand) shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than
    attorneys' fees and securities registration fees, incurred in
    connection with (A) the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4
    Registration Statement and the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and any
    amendments or supplements thereto and (B) the filing by the parties
    hereto of the premerger notification and report forms relating to the
    Transactions under the HSR Act and the filing of any notice or other

                                      B-30
<PAGE>

       (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent and the Purchaser or
    the Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and at or prior to the time of
    the termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have
    been disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made (and shall not
    have been withdrawn or terminated pursuant to a public announcement at
    least five days before the Shareholders' Meeting), or if this Agreement
    is terminated by Parent and the Purchaser or the Seller pursuant to
    Section 8.1(d) or by Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to Section
    8.1(e), then (without limiting any obligation of the Seller to pay any
    fee payable pursuant to Section 8.4(c)), the Seller shall make a
    nonrefundable cash payment to the Purchaser, at the time specified in
    Section 8.4(b), in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all
    reasonable fees and expenses (including all reasonable attorneys' fees,
    accountants' fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees) that have
    been paid or that may become payable by or on behalf of Parent or the
    Purchaser in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this
    Agreement and the other Transactional Agreements and otherwise in
    connection with the Transactions.

     (b) In the case of termination of this Agreement by the Seller pursuant
  to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d), any nonrefundable payment required to
  be made pursuant to clause "(ii)" of the proviso to Section 8.4(a) shall be
  made, by the Seller prior to the time of such termination; and in the case
  of termination of this Agreement by the Purchaser pursuant to Section
  8.1(b), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), any nonrefundable payment
  required to be made pursuant to clause "(ii)" of the proviso to Section
  8.4(a) shall be made by the Seller within two business days after such
  termination.

     (c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser or the Seller
  pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d) and at or prior to the time of
  the termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
  disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made, or (ii) this Agreement
  is terminated by Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then
  the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, in cash at the time specified in the
  next sentence (and in addition to the amounts payable pursuant to
  Section 8.4(a)), a nonrefundable fee in an amount equal to $3,300,000. In
  the case of termination of this Agreement by the Seller pursuant to Section

  disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of
  such overdue amount and the enforcement by Parent or the Purchaser of its
  rights under this Section 8.4, and (ii) the Seller shall pay to Parent or
  the Purchaser interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as
  of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
  ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to Parent or the
  Purchaser in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
  announced by Bank of America or any successor thereto) in effect on the
  date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

   8.5 Nonexclusivity Of Termination Rights. The termination rights provided in
Section 8.1 shall not be deemed to be exclusive. Accordingly, the exercise by
any party of its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1
shall not be deemed to be an election of remedies and shall not be deemed to
prejudice, or to constitute or operate as a waiver of, any other right or
remedy that such party may be entitled to exercise (whether under this
Agreement, under any other Contract, under any statute, rule or other Legal
Requirement, at common law, in equity or otherwise).

     (a) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of each
  party to this Agreement shall survive (without limitation): (i) the Closing
  and the sale of the Specified Assets to the Purchaser; (ii) any sale or
  other disposition of any or all of the Specified Assets by the Purchaser;
  and (iii) the dissolution or liquidation of any party to this Agreement.
  Except as set forth in Section 9.1(c), all of said representations,
  warranties, covenants and obligations shall remain in full force and effect
  and shall survive for a period of one year following the distribution of
  the Stock Consideration to the shareholders of the Seller pursuant to the
  Plan of Dissolution.

     (b) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the
  Seller, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the
  Indemnitees, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result
  of any information furnished to, or any investigation made by or any
  knowledge of, any of the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives.

     (c) The representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2 and 3
  shall expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date; provided,
  however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and
  warranties of Parent and the Purchaser shall expire not later than the date
  on which the Stock Consideration is paid to the Seller; and provided
  further, that if a Claim Notice (as defined below) relating to any
  representation or warranty set forth in any of said Sections is given to
  the Seller on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, then,
  notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.1(c),
  such representation or warranty shall not so expire, but rather shall
  remain in full force and effect until such time as each and every claim
  (including any indemnification claim asserted by any Indemnitee under
  Section 9.2) that is based directly or indirectly upon, or that relates
  directly or indirectly to, any Breach or alleged Breach of such
  representation or warranty has been fully and finally resolved, either by
  means of a written settlement agreement executed on behalf of the Seller,
  Parent and the Purchaser or by means of a final, non-appealable judgment
  issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

     (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Claim Notice" relating to a
  particular representation or warranty shall be deemed to have been given if
  any Indemnitee, acting in good faith, delivers to the Seller a written
  notice stating that such Indemnitee believes that there is or has been a
  possible Breach of such representation or warranty and containing (i) a
  brief description of the circumstances supporting such Indemnitee's belief
  that there is or has been such a possible Breach, and (ii) a non-binding,
  preliminary estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of the actual and
  potential Damages that have arisen and may arise as a direct or indirect
  result of such possible Breach.

     (e) For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or other item of
  information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or in any update to the
  Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty
  made by the Seller in this Agreement.

   9.2 Indemnification By The Seller. The Seller shall hold harmless and
indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and
reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages that are directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of
the Indemnitees may otherwise become subject at any time (regardless of whether
or not such Damages relate to any third-party claim) and that arise directly or
indirectly from or as a direct or indirect result of, or are directly or
indirectly connected with:

     (i) any Breach of any of the representations or warranties made by the
  Seller in this Agreement (without giving effect to any update to the
  Disclosure Schedule), both as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
  Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date, or in the Seller
  Closing Certificate or any of the other Transactional Agreements;

     (ii) any Breach of any representation, warranty, statement, information
  or provision contained in the Disclosure Schedule or in any other document
  delivered or otherwise made available to Parent or the Purchaser or any of
  their Representatives by or on behalf of the Seller or any Representative
  of the Seller;

                                      B-32
<PAGE>

     (iii) any Breach of any covenant or obligation of the Seller contained
  in any of the Transactional Agreements;

     (iv) any Liability of the Seller or of any Related Party, other than the
  Designated Contractual Obligations;

     (v) any Liability (other than the Designated Contractual Obligations) to
  which Parent, the Purchaser or any of the other Indemnitees may become
  subject and that arises directly or indirectly from or relates directly or
  indirectly to (A) any product produced or sold or any services performed by
  or on behalf of the Seller, (B) the presence of any Hazardous Material at
  any site owned, leased, occupied or controlled by the Seller on or at any
  time prior to the Closing Date, (C) the generation, manufacture,
  production, transportation, importation, use, treatment, refinement,
  processing, handling, storage, discharge, release or disposal of any
  Hazardous Material (whether lawfully or unlawfully) by or on behalf of the
  Seller, (D) the operation by the Seller of its business, or (E) any failure
  to comply with any bulk transfer law or similar Legal Requirement in
  connection with any of the Transactions; or

     (vi) any Proceeding relating directly or indirectly to any Breach,
  alleged Breach, Liability or matter of the type referred to in clause
  "(i)," "(ii)," "(iii)," "(iv)," "(v)" or "(vi)" above (including any
  Proceeding commenced by any Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing any of
  its rights under this Section 9).

   9.3 Setoff. In addition to any rights of setoff or other rights that Parent,
the Purchaser or any of the other Indemnitees may have at common law or
otherwise, Parent and the Purchaser shall have the right to withhold and deduct
any sum that may be owed to any Indemnitee under this Section 9 from any amount
(including all or any portion of the Stock Consideration) otherwise payable by
any Indemnitee to the Seller. The withholding and deduction of any such sum
shall operate for all purposes as a complete discharge (to the extent of such
sum) of the obligation to pay the amount from which such sum was withheld and
deducted and a release of the Seller from further liability with respect to
such obligation to the extent of such setoff. The exercise of such right of
setoff by Parent or the Purchaser in good faith, whether or not ultimately
determined to be justified, will not constitute an event of default under this
Agreement or any of the other Transactional Agreements.

   9.4 Nonexclusivity Of Indemnification Remedies. The indemnification remedies
and other remedies provided in this Section 9 shall not be deemed to be
exclusive. Accordingly, the exercise by any Person of any of its rights under
this Section 9 shall not be deemed to be an election of remedies and shall not
be deemed to prejudice, or to constitute or operate as a waiver of, any other
right or remedy that such Person may be entitled to exercise (whether under
this Agreement, under any other Contract, under any statute, rule or other
Legal Requirement, at common law, in equity or otherwise).

   9.5 Defense Of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Proceeding (whether against Parent
or the Purchaser, against any other Indemnitee or against any other Person)
with respect to which the Seller may become obligated to indemnify, hold
harmless, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9,
Parent and the Purchaser shall have the right, at its election, to designate
the Seller to assume the defense of such claim or Proceeding at the sole
expense of the Seller. If Parent or the Purchaser so elects to designate the
Seller to assume the defense of any such claim or Proceeding:

     (a) the Seller shall proceed to defend such claim or Proceeding in a
  diligent manner with counsel satisfactory to Parent and the Purchaser;

     (b) Parent and the Purchaser shall make available to the Seller any non-
  privileged documents and materials in the possession of Parent or the
  Purchaser that may be necessary to the defense of such claim or Proceeding;

     (c) the Seller shall keep Parent and the Purchaser informed of all
  material developments and events relating to such claim or Proceeding;

                                      B-33
<PAGE>

     (d) Parent and the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in the
  defense of such claim or Proceeding;

     (e) the Seller shall not settle, adjust or compromise such claim or
  Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which shall
  not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and

     (f) Parent and the Purchaser may at any time (notwithstanding the prior
  designation of the Seller to assume the defense of such claim or
  Proceeding) assume the defense of such claim or Proceeding.

If Parent and the Purchaser does not elect to designate the Seller to assume
the defense of any such claim or Proceeding (or if, after initially designating
the Seller to assume such defense, Parent or the Purchaser elects to assume
such defense), Parent or the Purchaser may proceed with the defense of such
claim or Proceeding on its own. If Parent or the Purchaser so proceeds with the
defense of any such claim or Proceeding on its own:

     (i) all expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Proceeding
  (whether or not incurred by Parent or the Purchaser) shall be borne and
  paid exclusively by the Seller;

     (ii) the Seller shall make available to Parent or the Purchaser any
  documents and materials in the possession or control of the Seller that may
  be necessary to the defense of such claim or Proceeding;

     (iii) Parent and the Purchaser shall keep the Seller informed of all
  material developments and events relating to such claim or Proceeding; and

     (iv) Parent and the Purchaser shall have the right to settle, adjust or
  compromise such claim or Proceeding with the consent of the Seller;
  provided, however, that the Seller shall not unreasonably withhold or delay
  such consent.

   9.6 Threshold. The Seller shall not be required to make any indemnification
payment pursuant to Section 9.2 for any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the

Board of Directors
3dfx Interactive, Inc.
4435 Fortran Drive
San Jose, CA 95134

Gentlemen:

   We understand that 3dfx Interactive, Inc. (the "Company") and NVIDIA
Corporation ("Nvidia") propose to enter into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the
"Agreement"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Agreement, the Company will sell certain assets related to its graphics
business to Nvidia in exchange for (i) $70 million in cash, (ii) subject to
reduction as set forth in the Agreement, 1,000,000 shares of common stock of
Nvidia ("Nvidia Common Stock"), and (iii) the assumption by Nvidia of certain
specified contractual obligations of the Company (the "Acquisition"). The
shares of Nvidia Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Acquisition will be
payable only upon the winding up of the business of the Company pursuant to a
plan of dissolution adopted by the board of directors of the Company (the
"Dissolution"), and will be subject to a right of setoff in favor of Nvidia
with respect to claims for indemnification under the Agreement. After the
closing of the Acquisition but prior to any payment of Nvidia Common Stock, the
Company, should it need additional cash to pay its liabilities, may request
that Nvidia provide up to an additional $25 million in cash, subject to certain
conditions (the "Post-Closing Advance"), and the number of shares of Nvidia
Common Stock deliverable will be accordingly reduced, based upon a per share
price of $50.00. Concurrently with the execution of the Agreement, we
understand that the Company and Nvidia will enter into a credit agreement (the
"Credit Agreement") pursuant to which Nvidia will provide to the Company a $15
million credit facility, and the parties will settle certain patent litigation
between them. Under the Agreement, amounts outstanding under the credit
facility are required to be repaid at the closing of the Acquisition. The terms
of the Acquisition will be set forth more fully in the Agreement.

   You have asked us to advise you as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, to the Company of the consideration to be received by the Company in
the Acquisition. Needham & Company, Inc., as part of its investment banking
business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of securities, private placements and
other purposes. We have been engaged by the Company as financial advisor to
render this opinion in connection with the Acquisition and will receive a fee
for our services, none of which is contingent on the consummation of the
Acquisition. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain
liabilities arising from our role as financial advisor and out of the rendering
of this opinion.

   For purposes of this opinion we have, among other things: (i) reviewed a
draft of the Agreement dated December 15, 2000, (ii) reviewed certain publicly
available information concerning the Company and certain other relevant
financial and operating data of the Company furnished to us by the Company,
including Company management's draft financial statements as of and for the
quarter ended October 31, 2000; (iii) held discussions with members of
management of the Company concerning the current and future business prospects
of the Company; (iv) reviewed and discussed with the management of the Company
certain financial forecasts and projections prepared by such management; (v)
reviewed the historical stock prices and trading volumes of common stock of the
Company ("Company Common Stock") and Nvidia Common Stock; (vi) compared certain
publicly available financial data of companies whose securities are traded in
the public markets and that

                                      C-1
<PAGE>

we deemed generally relevant to similar data for the Company and Nvidia; (vii)
reviewed the financial terms of certain other business combinations that we
deemed generally relevant; and (viii) performed and/or considered such other
studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as we deemed appropriate. In
addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the Company's
management and its representatives concerning the Company's views as to: the
anticipated adverse effects on the Company's business, assets, liabilities,
operations and prospects that the Company believes would occur if the Company
were not to enter into the Agreement and the Credit Agreement; the liquidity
position of the Company and its ability to continue as a going concern; the
Company's anticipated inability to remedy its liquidity shortfall and the
substantial risk of the Company becoming insolvent and seeking the protection
of state insolvency or federal bankruptcy law; the anticipated substantial
adverse effects on the Company's shareholders and present and potential
employees, business partners and lenders that would result from such insolvency
or concerns about the potential for it; and the anticipated benefits that would
arise from entering into the Agreement and Credit Agreement, including the
substantial lessening of such liquidity and solvency concerns. We have also
held discussions with the Company's financial advisors, Robertson Stephens,
Inc., as to their efforts to solicit third-party indications of interest for
the acquisition of the Company or all or substantially all of its assets and
for financing of the Company. We have not been authorized by the Company or its
Board of Directors to solicit, nor have we solicited, any such indications of
interest.

   In connection with our review and in arriving at our opinion, we have
assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and
other information reviewed by us for purposes of this opinion and have neither
attempted to verify independently nor assumed responsibility for verifying any
of such information. In addition, we have assumed, with your consent, (i) that
any material liabilities (contingent or otherwise, known or unknown) of the
Company are as set forth in the financial statements of the Company, (ii) that
the terms set forth in the executed Agreement will not differ materially from
the proposed terms provided to us in the draft Agreement dated December 15,
2000, (iii) that, other than as set forth in the Company's financial
statements, no asset or liability value should be attributed to the litigation
between the Company and Nvidia, and (iv) the accuracy of the Company's
representation in the Agreement that the cash consideration to be paid pursuant
to the Agreement will be sufficient to pay all of the Company's liabilities
other than those to be assumed by Nvidia, including taxes due and other amounts
owed as a result of the Acquisition. With respect to the Company's financial
forecasts provided to us by its management, we have assumed for purposes of our
opinion that such forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management, at the
time of preparation, of the future operating and financial performance of the
Company. We express no opinion with respect to such forecasts or the
assumptions on which they were based. The Company's management has estimated,
and we have for purposes of our analysis assumed, with your consent, that, in
the aggregate, the amount of the liabilities to be retained by the Company
after the Acquisition, including any liabilities incurred prior to the
Dissolution, will result in a cash deficiency, prior to any cash received
pursuant to the Post-Closing Advance, of between $5.27 million and $25.17
million. We have not assumed any responsibility for or made or obtained any
independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the assets or
liabilities of the Company. Further, our opinion is based on economic, monetary
and market conditions as they exist and can be evaluated as of the date hereof.

   Our opinion as expressed herein is limited to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the Company of the consideration to be received by the
Company in the Acquisition, and does not address the Company's underlying
business decision to engage in the Acquisition or Dissolution, the
consideration to be received by any individual shareholder in the Dissolution,
the relative merits of the Acquisition and Dissolution as compared to any
alternative business strategies that might exist for the Company, or the effect
of any other transaction in which the Company might engage. Our opinion does
not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how
such shareholder should vote on the proposed Acquisition or Dissolution. We are
not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Company Common Stock
or Nvidia Common Stock will actually trade at any time. We are expressing no
opinion on the Company's solvency nor are we expressing any opinion on the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern should the Acquisition and
Dissolution not be consummated.

                                      C-2
<PAGE>

   In the ordinary course of our business, we may actively trade the equity
securities of the Company and Nvidia for our own account or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
such securities.

   This letter and the opinion expressed herein are provided at the request and
for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be
quoted or referred to or used for any purpose without our prior written
consent, except that this letter may be disclosed in connection with any
information statement or proxy statement used in connection with the
Acquisition so long as this letter is quoted in full in such information
statement or proxy statement.

   Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that as of the
date hereof the consideration to be received by the Company in the Acquisition
is fair to the Company from a financial point of view.

                                          Very truly yours,

                                          /s/ Needham & Company, Inc.
                                          Needham & Company, Inc.

  of such Chattel Paper to verify with such parties, to Secured Party's
  satisfaction, the existence, amount and terms of any such Accounts,
  Contracts, Instruments or Chattel Paper.

   4. Representations and Warranties. Grantor hereby represents and warrants
to Secured Party that:

     (a) Except for the security interest granted to Secured Party under this
  Security Agreement and Permitted Liens, Grantor is the sole legal and
  equitable owner of each item of the Collateral in which it purports to
  grant a security interest hereunder, having good and marketable title
  thereto free and clear of any and all liens except for Permitted Liens.

     (b) No effective security agreement, financing statement, equivalent
  security or lien instrument or continuation statement covering all or any
  part of the Collateral exists, except such as may have been filed by
  Grantor in favor of Secured Party pursuant to this Security Agreement
  except for Permitted Liens.

     (c) This Security Agreement creates a legal and valid security interest
  on and in all of the Collateral in which Grantor now has rights, and all
  filings and other actions necessary or desirable to perfect and protect
  such security interest have been duly taken. Accordingly, Secured Party has
  a fully perfected first priority security interest in all of the Collateral
  in which Grantor now has rights subject only to Permitted Liens. This
  Security Agreement will create a legal and valid and fully perfected first
  priority security interest in the Collateral in which Grantor later
  acquires rights, when Grantor acquires those rights.

   5. Covenants. Grantor covenants and agrees with Secured Party that from and
after the date of this Security Agreement and until the Secured Obligations
have been performed and paid in full:

     (a) Further Assurances; Pledge of Instruments. At any time and from time
  to time, upon the written request of Secured Party, and at the sole expense
  of Grantor, Grantor shall promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all
  such further instruments and documents and take such further action as
  Secured Party may reasonably deem desirable to obtain the full benefits of
  this Security Agreement.

     (b) Maintenance of Records. Grantor shall keep and maintain at its own
  cost and expense satisfactory and complete records of the Collateral.

                                      E-4
<PAGE>

   6. Rights and Remedies Upon Default.

     (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
  Default, Secured Party may exercise, in addition to all other rights and
  remedies granted to it under this Security Agreement, all rights and
  remedies of a secured party under the UCC.

     (b) Grantor also agrees to pay all fees, costs and expenses of Secured
  Party, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred
  in connection with the enforcement of any of its rights and remedies
  hereunder and the Credit Agreement.

     (c) Grantor hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or any notice (to
  the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection
  with this Security Agreement or any Collateral.

     (d) The proceeds of any sale, disposition or other realization upon all
  or any part of the Collateral shall be distributed by Secured Party in the
  following order of priorities:

       First, to Secured Party in an amount sufficient to pay in full the
    reasonable costs of Secured Party in connection with such sale,
    disposition or other realization, including all fees, costs, expenses,
    liabilities and advances incurred or made by Secured Party in
    connection therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable
    attorneys' fees;

       Second, to Secured Party in an amount equal to the then unpaid
    Secured Obligations; and

       Finally, upon payment in full of the Secured Obligations, to Grantor
    or its representatives or as a court of competent jurisdiction may
    direct.

   7. Limitation on Secured Party's Duty in Respect of Collateral. Secured
Party shall be deemed to have acted reasonably in the custody, preservation and
disposition of any of the Collateral if it takes such action as Grantor
requests in writing, but failure of Secured Party to comply with any such
request shall not in itself be deemed a failure to act reasonably, and no
failure of Secured Party to do any act not so requested shall be deemed a
failure to act reasonably.

   8. Reinstatement. This Security Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against
Grantor for liquidation or reorganization, should Grantor become insolvent or
make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee
be appointed for all or any significant part of Grantor's property and assets,
and shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at
any time payment and performance of the Secured Obligations, or any part
thereof, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or
must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee of the Secured
Obligations, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent conveyance," or
otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the
event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or
returned, the Secured Obligations shall be reinstated and deemed reduced only
by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

   9. Miscellaneous.

     (a) No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.

       (i) Secured Party shall not by any act, delay, omission or otherwise
    be deemed to have waived any of its respective rights or remedies
    hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or
    remedy hereunder on any one occasion preclude the further exercise
    thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

       (ii) The rights and remedies hereunder provided are cumulative and
    may be exercised singly or concurrently, and are not exclusive of any
    rights and remedies provided by law.

  hereunder, inure to the benefit of Secured Party, any future holder of any
  of the indebtedness and their respective successors and assigns. No sales
  of participations, other sales, assignments, transfers or other
  dispositions of any agreement governing or instrument evidencing the
  Secured Obligations or any portion thereof or interest therein shall in any
  manner affect the lien granted to Secured Party hereunder.

  construction, interpretation, validity and performance, this Security
  Agreement and the Secured Obligations shall be governed by, and construed

    respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably (except as
    provided in Section 5.2 below) releases, acquits and forever discharges
    NVIDIA, their Affiliates, and their respective suppliers,
    manufacturers, distributors, and customers, direct and indirect, from
    any and all claims, demands, rights of action, and liability, whether
    known or unknown, relating to any one or more of the 3dfx Patents and
    relating to any act, event, or circumstance that occurred on or prior
    to the Effective Date, to the extent such act, event, or circumstance
    would have been permitted under the licenses granted to Purchaser in
    this Agreement if such license had been in existence at the time of
    such act, event, or circumstance. 3dfx further waives all rights under
    Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, and any law or legal
    principle of similar effect in any jurisdiction, as such rights may
    relate to any claims released pursuant to this Agreement.

       2.2. Purchaser and Parent, on behalf of themselves and their
    Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, hereby
    irrevocably (except as provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 below) release,

                                      G-2
<PAGE>

    acquit and forever discharge 3dfx and its suppliers, manufacturers,
    distributors, and customers, direct and indirect, from any and all
    claims, demands, rights of action, and liability, whether known or
    unknown, relating to any one or more of the NVIDIA Patents and relating
    to any act, event, or circumstance that occurred on or prior to the
    Effective Date, to the extent such act, event, or circumstance would
    have been permitted under the licenses granted to 3dfx in this
    Agreement if such license had been in existence at the time of such
    act, event, or circumstance. Purchaser and Parent further waive all
    rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, and any law or
    legal principle of similar effect in any jurisdiction, as such rights
    may relate to any claims released pursuant to this Agreement.

       2.3. Each party acknowledges that it has consulted with legal
    counsel regarding the import of Section 1542, which provides as
    follows:

      A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES
      NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING
      THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS
      SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

     3. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      3dfx covenants and agrees, for itself and on behalf of its
      Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, that neither
      3dfx nor any of its Affiliates shall commence, maintain, prosecute
      or voluntarily aid in any action at law, equity or any other
      proceeding against users, customers, manufacturers, suppliers, and
      distributors of NVIDIA Licensed Products based in whole or in part
      on any claim of infringement of any 3dfx Patent arising from the
      use, promotion, sale, offer for sale, importation or other
      distribution or transfer of NVIDIA Licensed Products, either alone
      or in combination with other products.

      Purchaser and Parent covenant and agree, for themselves and on
      behalf of their Affiliates and their respective successors and
      assigns, that neither NVIDIA nor any of their Affiliates shall
      commence, maintain, prosecute or voluntarily aid in any action at

      distributors of 3dfx Licensed Products based in whole or in part on
      any claim of infringement of any NVIDIA Patent arising from the use,
      promotion, sale, offer for sale, importation or other distribution
      or transfer of 3dfx Licensed Products, either alone or in
      combination with other products.

       3.4. Full Rights. In the event that neither 3dfx nor any of its
    Affiliates has the right to grant a license under any particular 3dfx
    Patent of the scope set forth herein, then the license granted herein
    under such 3dfx Patent shall be of the broadest scope within the scope
    set forth herein which 3dfx or any of its Affiliates has the right to
    grant. In the event that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has

       3.5. Specified Patents and Pending Claims. No rights, licenses,
    releases, or covenants (expressly including those set forth in Sections

    infringing the Specified Patents in the Suit.

     4. DISCLAIMER

       4.1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as:

         (a) a warranty or representation by 3dfx as to the validity,
      enforceability, or scope of any 3dfx Patent, or a warranty or
      representation by NVIDIA as to the validity, enforceability, or
      scope of any NVIDIA Patent;

         (b) a warranty or representation by 3dfx that any manufacture,
      sale, lease, use, or other disposition of NVIDIA Licensed Products
      hereunder will be free from infringement of any patents other than
      the 3dfx Patents, or a warranty or representation by NVIDIA that any
      manufacture, sale, lease, use, or other disposition of 3dfx Licensed
      Products hereunder will be free from infringement of any patents
      other than the NVIDIA Patents;

         (c) an agreement by either party to bring or prosecute actions or

      any party to furnish any technical information or know-how.

    The foregoing disclaimers shall not be construed to limit, modify, or
    in other way affect any representations or warranties made by 3dfx in
    the Credit Agreement or that certain Asset Purchase Agreement or any
    other agreement or document entered into or delivered in connection
    with the Credit Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement.

     5. TERMINATION

       5.1. Termination of 3dfx Licenses. All licenses, rights, releases,
    and covenants granted to 3dfx in this Agreement will immediately and
    automatically terminate (except only to the extent expressly provided
    below), without the requirement of notice from NVIDIA or any other
    action on the part of NVIDIA, upon the earliest to occur of the
    following events:

         (a) a Change in Control of 3dfx;

         (b) 3dfx admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they
      become due, files for any form of bankruptcy, has an involuntary
      bankruptcy petition filed against it; or makes an assignment for the
      benefit of creditors;

                                      G-4
<PAGE>

         (c) 3dfx dissolves, liquidates, or ceases to conduct business;

         (d) the Closing (as such term is defined in the Asset Purchase
      Agreement); or

         (e) the termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement for any
      reason.

    Upon termination of 3dfx's licenses and other rights as a result of a
    Change in Control of 3dfx, 3dfx (or its successor) will retain, for a
    period of one year from the date on which such Change in Control
    occurs, the rights licensed to 3dfx in Section 3.2, subject to the
    restrictions and limitations set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5
    and other applicable provisions of this Agreement, solely with respect
    to those 3dfx Licensed Products being manufactured, marketed, and sold
    at the time of such termination. The termination of 3dfx's licenses and
    other rights pursuant to this Section 5.1 will have no effect on the
    other provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and
    effect in accordance with their terms.

       5.2. Termination of Agreement. Without limiting Section 5.1, this
    Agreement will terminate and be of no further force or effect if and
    only if the Asset Purchase Agreement is terminated in any of the
    following ways:

         (i) by the parties pursuant to Section 8.1(a) of the Asset
      Purchase Agreement;

         (ii) by 3dfx pursuant to Section 8.1(b) of the Asset Purchase
      Agreement by reason of the failure of the Closing to occur by the
      date set forth therein solely as a result of the failure of Parent
      and the Purchaser to comply with their obligations under the Asset
      Purchase Agreement;

         (iii) by the parties pursuant to Section 8.1(c) of the Asset
      Purchase Agreement;

         (iv) by Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(f) of
      the Asset Purchase Agreement on the basis of an inaccuracy in the
      representations and warranties made by 3dfx in the Asset Purchase
      Agreement, or on the basis of a breach of the covenants of 3dfx in
      the Asset Purchase Agreement, if such inaccuracy or breach would not
      deprive the Purchaser and Parent of the material benefits of the
      Asset Purchase Agreement; or

         (v) by 3dfx pursuant to Section 8.1(g) of the Asset Purchase
      Agreement.

    Unless and until terminated pursuant to this Section 5.2, this
    Agreement will remain in effect indefinitely.

     6. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

       6.1 Authority. 3dfx represents and warrants that it has the right to
    grant NVIDIA the licenses granted to NVIDIA hereunder. The Purchaser
    and Parent represent and warrant that they have the right to grant 3dfx
    the licenses granted to 3dfx hereunder.

       6.2. Assignment. Subject to Section 3.1, this Agreement, and any
    rights or obligations hereunder, may not be assigned or delegated by
    any party without the prior written consent of the other parties,
    except that NVIDIA may assign this Agreement, or any of its rights
    under this Agreement, (a) to any of its Affiliates and (b) in
    connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of its
    business or assets (whether by sale, change in ownership, merger, or
    otherwise) with or without the consent of 3dfx. Any attempted
    assignment, delegation, or other transfer of this Agreement, or rights
    or obligations under this Agreement, by 3dfx in violation of this
    Section 6.2 will be null and void and will result in the immediate and
    automatic termination of all licenses granted to 3dfx, all releases and
    covenants made for the benefit of 3dfx or its suppliers, manufacturers,
    distributors, and customers, and all other rights of 3dfx under this
    Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding
    upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and
    permitted assigns.

       6.3. Patent Assignments. Neither 3dfx nor any of its Affiliates
    shall assign or transfer any of the 3dfx Patents to any third party
    unless such third party expressly agrees in writing that such
    assignment is made subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement. Unless and until 3dfx's

                                      G-5
<PAGE>

    licenses and other rights have been terminated pursuant to Section 5.1,
    neither NVIDIA nor any of their Affiliates shall assign or transfer any
    of the NVIDIA Patents to any third party unless such third party

    terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                     INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

Item 20. Indemnification of Directors and Officers

   Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, authorizes
a court to award or a corporation's board of directors to grant indemnification
to directors and officers in terms sufficiently broad to permit such
indemnification under certain circumstances for liabilities (including
reimbursement for expenses incurred) arising under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended. NVIDIA's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of NVIDIA's directors and
permissive indemnification of officers, employees and other agents to the
maximum extent permitted by the DGCL. NVIDIA has entered into indemnification
agreements with its directors. The indemnification agreements provide NVIDIA's
directors with further indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by the
DGCL. NVIDIA also has obtained directors and officers insurance to insure its
directors and officers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the securities laws.

Item 22. Undertakings

   The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:

     (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made,
  a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:

       (i) To include any prospectus required in Section 10(a)(3) of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended;

       (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after
    the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
    post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the
    aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth
    in the registration statement;

       (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan
    of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
    or any material change to such information in the registration
    statement; provided, however, that paragraphs (1)(i) and (1)(ii) do not
    apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective
    amendment by those paragraphs is contained in periodic reports filed by
    the Registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are incorporated by
    reference in the registration statement;

     (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the
  Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each such post-effective amendment
  shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
  securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
  time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof;

     (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment
  any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the
  termination of the offering;

     (4) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities
  Act of 1933, as amended, each filing of the registrant's annual report
  pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
  of 1934, as amended, that is incorporated by reference in the registration
  statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to
  the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
  time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof;

     (5) To respond to requests for information that is incorporated by
  reference into the prospectus pursuant to Items 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this
  form, within one business day of receipt of such request, and to send the
  incorporated documents by first class mail or other equally prompt means.
  This includes information contained in documents filed subsequent to the
  effective date of the registration statement through the date of responding
  to the request;

     (6) That, prior to any public reoffering of the securities registered
  hereunder through use of a prospectus which is a part of this registration
  statement, by any person or party who is deemed to be an underwriter within
  the meaning of Rule 145(c), the issuer undertakes that such reoffering
  prospectus will contain the information called for by the applicable
  registration form with respect to reofferings by persons who may be deemed
  underwriters, in addition to the information called for by the other Items
  of the applicable form;

     (7) That every prospectus (i) that is filed pursuant to paragraph (6)
  immediately preceding, or (ii) that purports to meet the requirements of
  section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is used in
  connection with an offering of securities subject to Rule 415, will be
  filed as a part of an

                                      II-2
<PAGE>

  amendment to the registration statement and will not be used until such
  amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of determining any liability
  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each such post-effective
  amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to
  the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
  time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; and

     (8) To supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information
  concerning a transaction, and NVIDIA's being acquired involved therein,
  that was not the subject of and included in the registration statement when
  it became effective.

   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the registrant pursuant to the provisions described under Item 20
above, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is,
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), to be
issued in connection with the Asset Purchase.

   In rendering this opinion, we have examined the following documents: (i) the
Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, (ii)
the resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on December
14, 2000, (iii) the Registration Statement and (iv) such other documents, legal
opinions and precedents, corporate and other records of the Company and
certificates of public officials and officers of the Company that we have
deemed necessary or appropriate to provide a basis for the below opinion.

   Based upon and subject to the foregoing, in our opinion the shares of Common
Stock of the Company which are being offered and sold by the Company pursuant
to the Registration Statement, when sold in the manner and for the
consideration contemplated by the Registration Statement, will be legally
issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

   We consent to the filing of this opinion as an Exhibit to the Registration
Statement and to the reference to our firm under the heading "Legal Matters."

Very truly yours,

    federal court located in Santa Clara County, California, any claim that
    Shareholder is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such
    court, that such legal proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient
    forum, that the venue of such proceeding is improper or that this
    Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced
    in or by such court.

                                       6

contemplated thereby (the "Acquisition") at any meeting of the shareholders of
the Company, however called, and in connection with any written action by
consent of shareholders of the Company:

     (i) in favor of the Acquisition, the approval of the Purchase Agreement
  and the principal terms thereof, in favor of each of the other actions
  contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and in favor of any action in
  furtherance of any of the foregoing; and

     (ii) in favor of the winding up and dissolution of the Company pursuant
  to the California Corporations Code following the consummation of the
  Acquisition (the "Winding Up and Dissolution");

     (iii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of
  any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company in the
  Purchase Agreement; and

     (iv) against the following actions (other than the Acquisition, the
  Winding Up and Dissolution and the other transactions contemplated by the
  Purchase Agreement): (A) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a
  merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company
  or any subsidiary of the Company; (B) any sale, lease or transfer of a
  material amount of assets of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company;
  (C) any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of the
  Company or any subsidiary of the Company; (D) any change in a majority of
  the board of directors of the Company; (E) any amendment to the Company's
  certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (F) any material change in the
  capitalization of the Company or the Company's corporate structure; and (G)
  any other action which is intended, or could reasonably be expected to
  impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the
  Acquisition or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase
  Agreement, or the Winding Up and Dissolution.

   The Shareholder may vote the Shares on all other matters not referred to in
this proxy, and the attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this
proxy with respect to such other matters.

   Subject to the provisions of Section 2.3 of the Voting Agreement, this proxy
shall be binding upon the heirs, estate, executors, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of the Shareholder (including any transferee of any of
the Shares).

applicable laws so as to be valid and enforceable to the fullest possible

thereof under such circumstances and in such jurisdiction shall not affect the

unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall not affect the
