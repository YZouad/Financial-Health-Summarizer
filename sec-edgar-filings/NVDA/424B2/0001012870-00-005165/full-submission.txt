Overview

   We design, develop and market graphics processors and related software for
personal computers and digital entertainment platforms. We provide a "top-to-
bottom" family of award-winning performance 3D graphics processors and graphics
processing units, or GPUs, that set the standard for performance, quality and
features for a broad range of desktop PCs, from professional workstations to
low-cost PCs. Our 3D graphics processors are used in a wide variety of
applications, including games, business productivity, the Internet and
industrial design. Our graphics processors were the first to incorporate a 128-
bit multi-texturing graphics architecture designed to deliver to users of our
products a highly immersive, interactive 3D experience with compelling visual
quality, realistic imagery and motion, stunning effects and complex object and
scene interaction at real-time frame rates. The NVIDIA TNT2, TNT2 M64 and Vanta
graphics processors deliver high performance 3D and 2D graphics at affordable
prices, making them the graphics hardware of choice for a wide range of
applications for both consumer and commercial use. Our graphics processors are
designed to be architecturally compatible backward and forward between
generations, giving our OEM customers and end users a low cost of ownership. We
are recognized for developing the world's first GPU, the GeForce 256, which
incorporates independent hardware transform and lighting processing units along
with a complete rendering pipeline into a single-chip architecture. Our current
GPUs, the GeForce2 Ultra, the GeForce2 GTS, the GeForce2 MX, the NVIDIA Quadro2
Pro and the Quadro2 MXR, process hundreds of billions of operations per second
and increase the PC's ability to render high-definition 3D scenes in real-time.
Our GPU family provides superior processing and rendering power at competitive
prices and is architected to deliver the maximum performance from industry
standards such as Microsoft's Direct3D API and SGI's OpenGL API on Windows 98,
Windows 2000 and Linux platforms. We have also developed an integrated core
logic/graphics chipset called Aladdin TNT2 through a partnership with Acer
Laboratories, Inc., or ALi, one of the leading suppliers of core logic chipsets
for the PC. The Aladdin TNT2 chipset brings NVIDIA-class graphics performance
and quality to the value PC segment.

   We designed our GPUs and graphics processors to enable PC OEMs and add-in
board manufacturers to build award-winning state-of-the-art interactive 3D
graphics capability while maintaining affordable prices. We believe that a PC's
interactive 3D graphics capability represents one of the primary means by which
users differentiate among various systems. PC users today can easily
differentiate the quality of graphics and prefer personal computers that
provide a superior visual experience. We believe that by developing 3D graphics
solutions that provide superior performance and address the key requirements of
the PC market, we will accelerate the adoption of 3D graphics throughout this
market.

   Our products currently are designed into products offered by virtually every
leading branded PC OEM, including Acer, Compaq, Dell, eMachines, Fujitsu-
Siemens, Gateway, HP, IBM, micronpc.com, NEC, Packard Bell NEC, SGI and Sony,
as well as leading CEMs, including Celestica, Intel, Mitac, MSI, SCI and
VisionTek, and leading add-in board manufacturers, including ASUSTek, Canopus,
Creative, ELSA and Guillemot. The benefits and performance of the NVIDIA family
of 3D graphics processors have received significant industry validation and
have enabled us and our customers to win more than 600 industry awards,
including over 20 "Editors' Choice" awards from PC Magazine during the last
three years, Edge Magazine's 1999 "Hardware Innovation of the Year,"
MicroDesign Research's "1999 Analyst's Choice for Best 3D Processor" and, in
the workstation market, Pro/E the Magazine's "Platinum Award."

                                    described under "Description of Notes-Redemption at
                                    Option of the Holder" in this prospectus supplement)
                                    at any time prior to October 15, 2007, you may
                                    require us to purchase all or part of your notes at
                                    a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding
                                    principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus
                                    accrued and unpaid interest.

 Sinking Fund.....................  None.


 Concurrent Offering..............  Concurrently with this offering, we also separately
                                    are offering shares of our common stock. The
                                    completion of this offering is not contingent upon
                                    the completion of the concurrent common stock
                                    offering.

 Use of Proceeds..................  To fund our anticipated growth, including
                                    anticipated increases in inventory and accounts
                                    receivable; for potential acquisitions; for costs
                                    associated with our expected move to new facilities;
                                    and for general working capital. See "Use of
                                    Proceeds" in this prospectus supplement.

                        RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING

   The notes are subordinated.

   The notes will be unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of
our existing and future senior indebtedness. In the event of our bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an
event of default under the indenture and in other limited events, our assets
will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior
indebtedness has been paid. As a result, there may not be sufficient assets
remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes. The notes
also will be effectively subordinated to the liabilities, including trade
payables, of any of our subsidiaries. Neither we nor our subsidiaries are
prohibited from incurring debt, including senior indebtedness, under the
indenture. If we or our subsidiaries were to incur additional debt or
liabilities, our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could suffer. We
and our subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional debt, including
senior indebtedness, and other liabilities. See "Description of Debt
Securities--Subordination" in the accompanying prospectus.

   We may be unable to redeem the notes upon a fundamental change.

   We may be unable to redeem the notes in the event of a fundamental change.
Upon a fundamental change, you may require us to redeem all or a portion of
your notes. If a fundamental change were to occur, we may not have enough
funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered notes. In addition, a
fundamental change could result in an event of default under loan agreements
we may enter into in the future. Our loan agreements could also prohibit, in
certain situations, redemptions of the notes. If a fundamental change occurs
at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing or redeeming notes, we could
seek the consent of our lenders to redeem the notes or could attempt to
refinance this debt. If we do not obtain a consent or refinance this debt, we
could not purchase or redeem the notes. Our failure to redeem tendered notes
would constitute an event of default under the indenture, which might
constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness. In these
circumstances, or if a fundamental change would constitute an event of default
under our senior indebtedness, the subordination provisions of the indenture
would restrict payments to the holders of notes. The term "fundamental change"
is limited to certain specified transactions and may not include other events
that might adversely affect our financial condition. Our obligation to offer
to redeem the notes upon a fundamental change would not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization,
merger or similar transaction involving NVIDIA. See "Description of Notes--
Redemption at Option of the Holder" in this prospectus supplement.

   A public market may not develop for the notes.

   Prior to the offering, there has been no trading market for the notes. The
underwriters have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in
the notes. However, the underwriters are not obligated to make a market and
may discontinue this market making activity at any time without notice. In
addition, market making activity by the underwriters will be subject to the
limits imposed by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. As a result, we cannot assure you that any market for the notes will
develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained. If an active
market for the notes fails to develop or be sustained, the trading price of
the notes could be materially adversely affected.

  Our stock price may continue to experience large short-term fluctuations
that may significantly affect the trading price of the notes.

   The price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly. Fluctuations in the
trading price of our common stock will affect the trading price of the notes.
These price fluctuations have been rapid and severe. The price of our common
stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of
company specific factors, including quarter to quarter variations in our
operating results, shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by
securities analysis and the other factors discussed in the accompanying
prospectus under the caption "Risk Factors--Our operating results are
unpredictable and may fluctuate."

                                USE OF PROCEEDS


   We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the notes we are selling
in this offering will be approximately $290.5 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional notes in this
offering, we estimate the aggregate net proceeds to us will be approximately
$334.2 million. Concurrently with this offering, we are offering 1,400,000
shares of our common stock. We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of
the 1,400,000 shares of common stock in the concurrent common stock offering
will be approximately $96.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The completion of this
offering is not contingent upon the completion of the concurrent common stock
offering. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes and the concurrent
common stock offering will be used to fund our anticipated growth, including
anticipated increases in inventory and accounts receivable; for potential
acquisitions; for costs associated with our expected move to new facilities;
and for general working capital.

                             DESCRIPTION OF NOTES

   The notes are to be issued under a subordinated indenture to be dated as of
October 12, 2000 and a supplemental indenture to that indenture to be dated as
of October 12, 2000, between us and Chase Manhattan Bank and Trust Company,
N.A., a national banking association, as trustee. We refer to the supplemental
indenture and the subordinated indenture, together, as the indenture. You may
request a copy of the indenture from the trustee.

   The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the
notes and the indenture. It does not purport to be complete. This summary is
subject to and is qualified by reference to all the provisions of the
indenture, including the definitions of certain terms used in the indenture.
Wherever particular provisions or defined terms of the indenture or form of
note are referred to, these provisions or defined terms are incorporated in
this prospectus supplement by reference. This description of the particular
terms of the notes supplements, and to the extent inconsistent with the
description of the general terms of the subordinated debt securities and
subordinated indenture set forth in the accompanying prospectus under
"Description of Debt Securities," replaces the description in the accompanying
prospectus.

   As used in this "Description of Notes" section, references to "NVIDIA,"
"we," "our" or "us" refer solely to NVIDIA and not any of our subsidiaries.

General

   The notes will be our general unsecured obligations. Our payment
obligations under the notes will be subordinated to our senior indebtedness,
if any, as described in the accompanying prospectus under the caption
"Description of Debt Securities--Subordination." The notes are convertible
into common stock as described in this prospectus supplement under the caption
"--Conversion of Notes."

   The notes will be limited to $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount
($345,000,000 aggregate principal amount if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is fully exercised). The notes will be issued only in denominations of
$1,000 and multiples of $1,000. The notes will mature on October 15, 2007
unless earlier converted, redeemed at our option or redeemed at your option
upon a fundamental change.

   We are not subject to any financial covenants under the indenture. In
addition, we are not restricted under the indenture from paying dividends,
incurring debt, including senior indebtedness, or issuing or repurchasing our
securities.

   You are not afforded protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction, or a change in control of us under the indenture except to the
extent described below in this prospectus supplement under the caption "--
Redemption at Option of the Holder."

   We will pay interest on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning
April 15, 2001 to record holders at the close of business on the preceding
April 1 and October 1, as the case may be, except:


  .  interest payable upon redemption will be paid to the person to whom
     principal is payable, unless the redemption date is an interest payment
     date; and

  .  as set forth in the next sentence.

   If you convert your note into common stock during the period after any
record date for the payment of interest but prior to the next interest payment
date, one of the following will occur:

  .  we will not be required to pay interest on the interest payment date if
     the note has been called for redemption on a redemption date that occurs
     during this period;

  .  we will not be required to pay interest on the interest payment date if
     the note is to be redeemed in connection with a fundamental change on a
     repurchase date that occurs during this period; or

                                      S-7
<PAGE>

  .  if otherwise, any note not called for redemption that is submitted for
     conversion during this period must also be accompanied by an amount
     equal to the interest due on the interest payment date on the converted
     principal amount, unless at the time of conversion there is a default in
     the payment of interest on the notes. See "--Conversion of Notes" in
     this prospectus supplement.

   We will maintain an office in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New
York for the payment of interest, which shall initially be an office or agency
of the trustee.

   We may pay interest either:

  .  by check mailed to your address as it appears in the note register,
     provided that if you are a holder with an aggregate principal amount in
     excess of $2.0 million, you shall be paid, at your written election, by
     wire transfer in immediately available funds; or

  .  by transfer to an account maintained by you in the United States.

   However, payments to The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York,
which we refer to as DTC, will be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of DTC or its nominee. Interest will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months.

Form, Denomination and Registration

   The notes will be issued:

  .  in fully registered form;

  .  without interest coupons; and

  .  in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples of
     $1,000.

   The notes will be evidenced by one or more global notes. We will deposit
the global note or notes with DTC and register the global notes in the name of
Cede & Co., as DTC's nominee. See "Description of Debt Securities--Book Entry
System" in the accompanying prospectus.

Conversion of Notes

   You may convert your note, in whole or in part, into common stock through
the final maturity date of the notes, subject to prior redemption of the
notes. If we call notes for redemption, you may convert the notes only until
the close of business on the business day prior to the redemption date unless
we fail to pay the redemption price. If you have submitted your notes for
redemption upon a fundamental change, you may convert your notes only if you
withdraw your conversion election. You may convert your notes in part so long
as this part is $1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000. If
any notes not called for redemption are converted after a record date for any
interest payment date and prior to the next interest payment date, the notes
must be accompanied by an amount equal to the interest payable on the interest
payment date on the converted principal amount unless a default exists at the
time of conversion.

   The initial conversion price for the notes is $92.71 per share of common
stock, subject to adjustment as described below. We will not issue fractional
shares of common stock upon conversion of notes. Instead, we will pay cash
equal to the market price of the common stock on the business day prior to the
conversion date. Except as described below, you will not receive any accrued
interest or dividends upon conversion.

   To convert your note into common stock you must:

  .  complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the note
     or facsimile of the conversion notice and deliver this notice to the
     conversion agent;

  .  surrender the note to the conversion agent;

                                      S-8
<PAGE>

  .  if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents;

  .  if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes; and

  .  if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next interest
     payment date.

   The date you comply with these requirements is the conversion date under
the indenture.

   We will adjust the conversion price if the following events occur:

  (1) we issue common stock as a dividend or distribution on our common
      stock;

  (2) we issue to all holders of common stock certain rights or warrants to
      purchase our common stock, unless we elect to distribute or reserve for
      distribution such rights or warrants for distribution to the holder of
      the notes upon the conversion of the notes;

  (3) we subdivide or combine our common stock;

  (4) we distribute to all common stock holders capital stock, evidences of
      indebtedness or assets, including securities but excluding:

     .  rights or warrants listed in (2) above;

     .  dividends or distributions listed in (1) above; and

     .  cash distributions listed in (5) below;

  (5) we distribute cash, excluding any quarterly cash dividend on our common
      stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of
      common stock in any quarter does not exceed the greater of:

    .  the amount per share of common stock of the next preceding quarterly
       cash dividend on the common stock to the extent that the preceding
       quarterly dividend did not require an adjustment of the conversion
       price pursuant to this clause (5), as adjusted to reflect
       subdivisions or combinations of the common stock; and

    .  3.75% of the average of the last reported sale price of the common
       stock during the ten trading days immediately prior to the
       declaration date of the dividend, and excluding any dividend or
       distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or
       winding up of NVIDIA.

     If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause (5) as a
     result of a distribution that is a quarterly dividend, the adjustment
     would be based upon the amount by which the distribution exceeds the
     amount of the quarterly cash dividend permitted to be excluded pursuant
     to this clause (5). If an adjustment is required to be made under this
     clause (5) as a result of a distribution that is not a quarterly
     dividend, the adjustment would be based upon the full amount of the
     distribution;

  (6) we or one of our subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender
      offer or exchange offer for our common stock to the extent that the
      cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per
      share of common stock exceeds the current market price per share of
      common stock on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which
      tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange
      offer; and

  (7) someone other than us or one of our subsidiaries makes a payment in
     respect of a tender offer or exchange offer in which, as of the closing
     date of the offer, our Board of Directors is not recommending rejection
     of the offer. The adjustment referred to in this clause (7) will only be
     made if:

    .  the tender offer or exchange offer is for an amount that increases
       the offeror's ownership of common stock to more than 25% of the total
       shares of common stock outstanding; and

    .  the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment
       per share of common stock exceeds the current market price per share
       of common stock on the business day next succeeding the last date on
       which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to the tender or
       exchange offer.

                                      S-9
<PAGE>

     However, the adjustment referred to in this clause (7) will generally
     not be made if as of the closing of the offer, the offering documents
     disclose a plan or an intention to cause us to engage in a consolidation
     or merger of NVIDIA or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

   To the extent that NVIDIA has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of
the notes into common stock, you will receive, in addition to the common
stock, the rights under the rights plan whether or not the rights have
separated from the common stock at the time of conversion, subject to limited
exceptions.

   In the event of:

    .  any reclassification of our common stock;

    .  a consolidation, merger or combination involving NVIDIA; or

    .  a sale or conveyance to another person of the property and assets of
       NVIDIA as an entirety or substantially as an entirety,

in which holders of common stock would be entitled to receive stock, other
securities, other property, assets or cash for their common stock, holders of
notes will generally be entitled thereafter to convert their notes into the
same type of consideration received by common stock holders immediately prior
to one of these types of events.

   You may in certain situations be deemed to have received a distribution
subject to United States federal income tax as a dividend in the event of any
taxable distribution to holders of common stock or in certain other situations
requiring a conversion price adjustment. See "Certain Federal Income Tax
Considerations" in this prospectus supplement.

   We may, from time to time, reduce the conversion price for a period of at
least 20 days if our board of directors has made a determination that this
reduction would be in our best interests. Any such determination by our board
will be conclusive. We would give holders at least 15 days' notice of any
reduction in the conversion price. In addition, we may reduce the conversion
price if our board of directors deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any
income tax to holders of common stock resulting from any stock or rights
distribution. See "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" in this
prospectus supplement.

   We will not be required to make an adjustment in the conversion price
unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the conversion
price. However, we will carry forward any adjustments that are less than one
percent of the conversion price. Except as described above in this section, we
will not adjust the conversion price for any issuance of our common stock or
convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase our common stock
or convertible or exchangeable securities.

Optional Redemption by NVIDIA

   The notes are not entitled to any sinking fund. At any time on or after
October 20, 2003, we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the following
prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount:

excluding, the redemption date. If the redemption date is an interest payment
date, interest shall be paid to the record holder on the relevant record date.
We are required to give notice of redemption by mail to holders not more than
60 but not less than 30 days prior to the redemption date.

                                     S-10
<PAGE>

   If less than all of the outstanding notes are to be redeemed, the trustee
shall select the notes to be redeemed in principal amounts of $1,000 or
integral multiples of $1,000 by lot, pro rata or by another method the trustee
considers fair and appropriate. If a portion of your notes is selected for
partial redemption and you convert a portion of your notes, the converted
portion shall be deemed to be of the portion selected for redemption.

   We may not redeem the notes if we have failed to pay any interest or
premium on the notes and such failure to pay is continuing. We will issue a
press release if we redeem the notes.

Redemption at Option of the Holder

   If a fundamental change occurs prior to October 15, 2007, you may require
us to redeem your notes, in whole or in part, on a repurchase date that is 30
days after the date of our notice of the fundamental change. The notes will be
redeemable in multiples of $1,000 principal amount.

   We shall redeem the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
If the repurchase date is an interest payment date, we will pay interest on
the interest payment date to the record holder on the relevant record date.

   We will mail to all record holders a notice of the fundamental change
within 10 days after the occurrence of the fundamental change. We are also
required to deliver to the trustee a copy of the fundamental change notice. If
you elect to redeem your notes, you must deliver to us or our designated
agent, on or before the 30th day after the date of our fundamental change
notice, your redemption notice and any notes to be redeemed, duly endorsed for
transfer. Following the repurchase date we will pay promptly the redemption
price for notes surrendered for redemption.

   A "fundamental change" is any transaction or event in connection with which
all or substantially all of our common stock shall be exchanged for, converted
into, acquired for or constitute solely the right to receive, consideration,
whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer,
consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise, which is not all or substantially all common stock listed on, or
that will be:

  .  listed on or immediately after the transaction or event on a United
     States national securities exchange; or

  .  approved for quotations on or immediately after the transaction or event
     on the Nasdaq National Market or any similar United States system of
     automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices.

   We will comply with any applicable provisions of Rule 13e-4 and any other
tender offer rules under the Exchange Act in the event of a fundamental
change.

   These fundamental change redemption rights could discourage a potential
acquiror of NVIDIA. However, this fundamental change redemption feature is not
the result of management's knowledge of any specific effort to obtain control
of NVIDIA by means of a merger, tender offer or solicitation, or part of a
plan by management to adopt a series of anti-takeover provisions. The term
"fundamental change" is limited to certain specified transactions and may not
include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition. Our
obligation to offer to redeem the notes upon a fundamental change would not
necessarily afford you protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving NVIDIA.

   We may be unable to redeem the notes in the event of a fundamental change.
If a fundamental change were to occur, we may not have enough funds to pay the
redemption price for all tendered notes. In addition, a fundamental change
could result in an event of default under loan agreements we may enter into in
the future. Our loan agreements could also prohibit, in certain situations,
redemptions of the notes. Any future credit facilities or other agreements
relating to our indebtedness may contain similar provisions, or expressly
prohibit the repurchase of the notes.

                                     S-11
<PAGE>

Defeasance

   There are no defeasance provisions applicable to the notes. If a
fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing or
redeeming notes, we could seek the consent of our lenders to redeem the notes
or could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do not obtain a consent or
refinance the debt, we could not purchase or redeem the notes. Our failure to
redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the
indenture, which might constitute a default under the terms of our other
indebtedness. In such circumstances, or if a fundamental change would
constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness, the
subordination provisions of the indenture would restrict payments to the
holders of notes.

Deductability of Interest

   Under Section 163(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, no
deduction is permitted for interest paid or accrued on any indebtedness of a
corporation that is "payable in equity" of the issuer or a related party. Debt
is treated as debt payable in equity of the issuer if the debt is part of an
arrangement designed to result in payment of the instrument with or by
reference to the equity. Such arrangements could include debt instruments that
are convertible at the holder's option if it is substantially certain that the
option will be exercised. The legislative history indicates that it is not
expected the provision will affect debt with a conversion feature where the
conversion price is significantly higher than the market price of the stock on
the date of the debt issuance. Accordingly, we do not believe that our
interest deduction with respect to interest payments on the notes will be
adversely affected by these rules.

                   CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

   The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
notes and common stock into which notes may be converted, but does not purport
to be a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations relating
thereto. This summary is based on laws, regulations, rulings and decisions now
in effect, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretation
possibly with retroactive effect. Except as specifically discussed below with
regard to Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below), this summary applies only to
beneficial owners that will hold notes and common stock into which notes may
be converted as "capital assets" (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) and who, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, are (i) individual citizens or residents of the
U.S., (ii) corporations, partnerships or other entities created or organized
in or under the laws of the U.S. or of any political subdivision thereof
(unless, in the case of a partnership, Treasury Regulations otherwise
provide), (iii) estates, the incomes of which are subject to U.S. federal
income taxation regardless of the source of such income or (iv) trusts subject
to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more U.S.
persons ("U.S. Holders") or any trust that has a valid election in effect
under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. Persons
other than U.S. Holders ("Non-U.S. Holders") are subject to special U.S.
federal income tax considerations, some of which are discussed below. This
discussion does not address tax considerations applicable to an investor's
particular circumstances or to investors that may be subject to special tax
rules, such as banks or other financial institutions, holders subject to the
alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies,
regulated investment companies, foreign persons or entities (except to the
extent specifically set forth below), dealers in securities, commodities or
currencies, holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar,
persons that will hold notes as a position in a hedging transaction,
"straddle" or "conversion transaction" for tax purposes or persons deemed to
sell notes or common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.
This summary discusses the tax considerations applicable to initial holders of
the notes who purchase the notes at their "issue price" as defined in Section
1273 of the Code and does not discuss the tax considerations applicable to
subsequent purchasers of the notes. We have not sought any ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or an opinion of counsel with respect to
the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and
there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and
conclusions. In addition, the IRS is not precluded from successfully adopting
a contrary position. This summary does not consider the effect of the federal
estate or gift tax laws or the tax laws (except as set forth below with
respect to Non-U.S. Holders) of any applicable foreign, state, local or other
jurisdiction.

   INVESTORS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX
ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME
TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES
ARISING UNDER THE FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX RULES OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY
STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX
TREATY.

U.S. Holders

   Taxation of Interest

   Interest paid on the notes will be included in the income of a U.S. Holder
as ordinary income at the time it is treated as received or accrued, in
accordance with such holder's regular method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Under Treasury Regulations, the possibility of an
additional payment under a note may be disregarded for purposes of determining
the amount of interest or original issue discount income to be recognized by a
holder in respect of such note (or the timing of such recognition) if the
likelihood of the payment, as of the date the notes are issued, is remote. In
the event of a fundamental change, a holder may require us to redeem any and
all of his notes. We intend to take the position that the possibility of a
fundamental change is remote under the Treasury Regulations, and thus do not
intend to treat such possibility of a "fundamental change" as affecting the
yield to maturity of any note. In the event a fundamental change occurs, it
would affect the amount and timing of the income that must be recognized by a
U.S. Holder of notes. There can be no assurance that the

                                     S-13
<PAGE>

IRS will agree with such position. Our determination that there is a remote
likelihood of paying additional interest on the notes is binding on each U.S.
Holder unless the holder explicitly discloses in the manner required by
applicable Treasury Regulations that its determination is different from ours.

   Sale, Exchange or Redemption of the Notes

   Upon the sale, exchange (other than a conversion) or redemption of a note,
a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
difference between (i) the amount of cash proceeds and the fair market value
of any property received on the sale, exchange or redemption (except to the
extent such amount is attributable to accrued interest income not previously
included in income, which will be taxable as ordinary income, or is
attributable to accrued interest that was previously included in income, which
amount may be received without generating further income) and (ii) such
holder's adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in
a note generally will equal the cost of the note to such holder. Such capital
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's
holding period in the note is more than one year at the time of sale, exchange
or redemption. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain noncorporate U.S.
Holders, including individuals, will generally be subject to a maximum federal
rate of tax of 20%. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

   Conversion of the Notes

   A U.S. Holder generally should not recognize any income, gain or loss upon
conversion of a note into common stock except with respect to cash received in
lieu of a fractional share of common stock and with respect to market
discount, as described above under "--Market Discount." A U.S. Holder's tax
basis in the common stock received on conversion of a note should be the same
as such holder's adjusted tax basis in the note at the time of conversion
(reduced by any basis allocable to a fractional share interest), and the
holding period for the common stock received on conversion should generally
include the holding period of the note converted.

   Cash received in lieu of a fractional share of common stock upon conversion
will be treated as a payment in exchange for the fractional share of common
stock. Accordingly, the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share of
common stock generally will result in capital gain or loss (measured by the
difference between the cash received for the fractional share and the holder's
adjusted tax basis in the fractional share).

   Distributions on Common Stock

   Distributions, if any, made on the common stock after a conversion
generally will be included in the income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary dividend
income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits.
Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits
will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder's
basis in the common stock and thereafter as capital gain. A dividend
distribution to a corporate U.S. holder may qualify for a dividends received
deduction.

   Adjustment of Conversion Price

   Holders of convertible debt instruments such as the notes may, in certain
circumstances, be deemed to have received distributions of stock if the
conversion price of such instruments is adjusted. Adjustments to the
conversion price made pursuant to a bona fide reasonable adjustment formula
which has the effect of preventing the dilution of the interest of the holders
of the debt instruments, however, will generally not be considered to result
in a constructive distribution of stock. Certain of the possible adjustments
provided in the notes (including, without limitation, adjustments in respect
of taxable dividends to our stockholders) will not qualify as being pursuant
to a bona fide reasonable adjustment formula. If such adjustments are made,
the U.S. Holders of notes will be deemed to have received constructive
distributions taxable as dividends to the extent of our current and
accumulated earnings and profits even though they have not received any cash
or property as a result of such adjustments. In certain circumstances, the
failure to provide for such an adjustment may result in taxable dividend
income to the U.S. Holders of common stock.

                                     S-14
<PAGE>

   Sale of Common Stock

   Upon the sale or exchange of common stock a U.S. Holder generally will
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount
of cash and the fair market value of any property received upon the sale or
exchange and (ii) such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock.
Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
Holder's holding period in common stock is more than one year at the time of
the sale or exchange. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-
corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, will generally be subject to a
maximum federal rate of tax of 20%. A U.S. Holder's basis and holding period
in common stock received upon conversion of a note are determined as discussed
above under "Conversion of the Notes." The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

   Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

   Backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 31% may apply to
payments pursuant to the terms of a note or common stock to a U.S. Holder that
is not an "exempt recipient" and that fails to provide certain identifying
information (such as the holder's TIN) in the manner required. Generally,
individuals are not exempt recipients, whereas corporations and certain other
entities are exempt recipients. Payments made in respect of a note or common
stock must be reported to the Service, unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt
recipient or otherwise establishes an exemption. The amount of any backup
withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit
against the U.S. Holder's federal income tax liability and may entitle such
holder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the
IRS.

   Treasury Regulations, generally effective after December 31, 2000, subject
to certain transition rules, modify the currently effective information
withholding and backup withholding procedures and requirements. U.S. Holders
should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the new
withholding regulations.

Special Tax Rules Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders

   Taxation of Interest

   In general, subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding,
payments of interest on the notes by us or any paying agent to a beneficial
owner of a note that is a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S.
withholding tax, provided that, (i) such Non-U.S. Holder does not own,
actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock entitled to vote within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)
of the Code, (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder is not a "controlled foreign
corporation" with respect to which we are a "related person" within the
meaning of the Code, (iii) such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank receiving
interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, and (iv) the
certification requirements under Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code
and Treasury Regulations thereunder are satisfied.

   Interest on notes not excluded from U.S. withholding tax generally will be
a subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, except where an applicable
tax treaty provides for the reduction or elimination of such withholding tax.

   To satisfy the certification requirements referred to in (iv), above,
Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of the Code and currently effective Treasury
Regulations thereunder require that either (i) the beneficial owner of a note
must certify, under penalties of perjury, to us or our paying agent, as the
case may be, that such owner is a Non-U.S. Holder and must provide such
owner's name and address, and U.S. taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), if
any, or (ii) a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial
institution that holds customer securities in the ordinary course of its trade
or business (a "Financial Institution") and holds the note on behalf of the
beneficial owner thereof must certify, under penalties of perjury, to us or
our paying agent, as the case may be, that such certificate has been received
from the beneficial owner and must furnish the payor with a copy thereof. Such
requirement will be fulfilled if the beneficial owner of a note certifies on
IRS Form W-8BEN or successor

                                     S-15
<PAGE>

form, under penalties of perjury, that it is a Non-U.S. Holder and provides
its name and address or any Financial Institution holding the note on behalf
of the beneficial owner files a statement with the withholding agent to the
effect that it has received such a statement from the beneficial owner (and
furnishes the withholding agent with a copy thereof).

   Treasury Regulations effective for payments made after December 31, 2000,
will provide alternative methods for satisfying the certification requirements
described above and below, subject to certain grandfathering provisions. These
new regulations also require, in the case of notes held by a foreign
partnership, that (i) the certification be provided by the partners rather
than by the foreign partnership and (ii) the partnership provide certain
information, including a TIN. A look-through rule will apply in the case of
tiered partnerships.

   If a Non-U.S. Holder of a note is engaged in a trade or business in the
U.S. and if interest on the note is effectively connected with the conduct of
such trade or business (and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to
a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.),
the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from U.S. withholding tax (provided that
the certification requirements discussed in the next sentence are met), will
generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such interest on a net
income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder. In lieu of the
certificate described above, such a Non-U.S. Holder will be required, under
currently effective Treasury Regulations, to provide us with a properly
executed IRS Form W-8ECI or 4224 or successor form in order to claim an
exemption from withholding tax. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a
foreign corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30%
(or such lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) of its effectively
connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain
adjustments.

   Conversion of the Notes

   A Non-U.S. Holder generally should not be subject to U.S. federal
withholding tax on the conversion of a note into common stock. To the extent a
Non-U.S. Holder receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of common stock
upon conversion, such cash may give rise to gain that would be subject to the
rules described below with respect to the sale or exchange of a note or common
stock. See "--Sale, Exchange or Redemption of the Notes or Common Stock"
below.

   Adjustment of Conversion Price

   The conversion price of the notes is subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances. Any such adjustment could, in certain circumstances, give rise
to a deemed distribution to Non-U.S. Holders of the notes. See "--U.S.
Holders--Adjustment of Conversion Price" above. In such case, the deemed
distribution would be subject to the rules below regarding withholding of U.S.
federal tax on dividends in respect of common stock.

   Distributions on Common Stock

   Distributions on common stock will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal
income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and
profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Dividends paid
on common stock held by a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal
withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate, if applicable) unless
the dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or
business by the Non-U.S. Holder and, if required by a tax treaty, is
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained in the United States, in
which case the dividend will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on net
income that applies to U.S. persons generally (and with respect to corporate
holders under certain circumstances, the branch profits tax). A Non-U.S.
Holder may be required to satisfy certain requirements in order to claim a
reduction of or exemption from withholding under the foregoing rules. However,
prior to January 1, 2001, for purposes of an applicable tax treaty, if a
stockholder's address is outside the United States it will be assumed that
such stockholder is a citizen or resident of that country absent the payor's
knowledge to the contrary.

                                     S-16
<PAGE>

   Sale, Exchange or Redemption of the Notes or Common Stock

   A Non-U.S. Holder of a note or common stock will not be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on gains realized on the sale, exchange or other
disposition of such note or common stock unless (i) such Non-U.S. Holder is an
individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year
of sale, exchange or other disposition, and certain conditions are met, (ii)
such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of
a trade or business in the U.S. and, if certain U.S. income tax treaties
apply, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the
Non-U.S. Holder, (iii) the Non-U.S. Holder is subject to Code provisions
applicable to certain U.S. expatriates, or (iv) in the case of a note or
common stock held by a person who holds more than 5% of such stock, we are or
have been, at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding
such sale or other disposition or the period such Non-U.S. Holder held the
common stock, a U.S. real property holding corporation (a "USRPHC") for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. We do not believe that we currently are a USRPHC
or that we will become one in the future.

   U.S. Federal Estate Tax

   A note held by an individual who at the time of death is not a citizen or
resident of the U.S. (as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax
purposes) will not be subject to U.S. federal estate tax if the individual did
not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting
power of all classes of our stock and, at the time of the individual's death,
payments with respect to such note would not have been effectively connected
with the conduct by such individual of a trade or business in the U.S. Common
stock held by an individual who at the time of death is not a citizen or
resident of the U.S. (as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax
purposes) will be included in such individual's estate for U.S. federal estate
tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty otherwise applies.

   Non-U.S. Holders should consult with their tax advisors regarding U.S. and
foreign tax consequences with respect to the notes and common stock.

   Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

   In the case of payments of interest on a note to a Non-U.S. Holder,
Treasury Regulations provide that backup withholding and information reporting
will not apply to payments with respect to which either requisite
certification has been received or an exemption has otherwise been established
(provided that neither we nor our paying agent has actual knowledge that the
holder is a U.S. Holder or that the conditions of any other exemption are not
in fact satisfied).

   Dividends on the common stock paid to Non-U.S. Holders that are subject to
U.S. withholding tax, as described above, generally will be exempt from U.S.
backup withholding tax but will be subject to certain information reporting.

   Payments of the proceeds of the sale of a note or common stock to or
through a foreign office of a U.S. broker or a foreign broker that is a
"controlled foreign corporation" within the meaning of the Code or a foreign
person, 50% or more of whose gross income from all sources for the three-year
period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the payment was
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S.)
are currently subject to certain information reporting requirements, unless
the payee is an exempt recipient or such broker has evidence in its records
that the payee is a non-U.S. holder and no actual knowledge that such evidence
is false and certain other conditions are met. Temporary Treasury Regulations
indicate that such payments are not currently subject to backup withholding.

   Under current Treasury Regulations, payments of the proceeds of a sale of a
note or common stock to or through the U.S. office of a broker will be subject
to information reporting and backup withholding unless the payee certifies
under penalties of perjury as to his or her status as a Non-U.S. Holder and
satisfies certain other qualifications (and no agent of the broker who is
responsible for receiving or reviewing such statement has actual

                                     S-17
<PAGE>

knowledge that it is incorrect) and provides his or her name and address or
the payee otherwise establishes an exemption.

   Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a
Non-U.S. Holder of a note or common stock will be allowed as a credit against
such holder's U.S. federal income tax, if any, or will be otherwise refundable
provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely
manner.

   As noted above, new regulations will generally be applicable to payments
made after December 31, 2000. In general, these new regulations do not
significantly alter the substantive withholding and information reporting
requirements but unify current certification procedures and forms and clarify
reliance standards. Under these new regulations, special rules apply which
permit the shifting of primary responsibility for withholding to certain
financial intermediaries acting on behalf of beneficial owners. A Non-U.S.
Holder of a note or common stock should consult with its tax advisor regarding
the application of the backup withholding rules to its particular situation,
the availability of an exemption therefrom, the procedure for obtaining such
an exemption, if available, and the impact of these new regulations on
payments made with respect to notes or common stock after December 31, 2000.

   THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. ACCORDINGLY, EACH
PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISER AS TO THE PARTICULAR
U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, HOLDING AND
DISPOSING OF THE NOTES AND OUR COMMON STOCK. TAX ADVISORS SHOULD ALSO BE
CONSULTED AS TO THE U.S. ESTATE AND GIFT TAX CONSEQUENCES AND THE FOREIGN TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF OUR NOTES AND COMMON
STOCK, AS WELL AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGE IN APPLICABLE LAWS.

Other Tax Consequences

   Market Discount

   The resale of the notes may be affected by the impact on a purchaser of the
"market discount" provisions of the Code. For this purpose, the market
discount on the notes generally will be equal to the amount, if any, by which
the stated redemption price at maturity of the notes immediately after
acquisition (other than at original issue) exceeds the holder's adjusted tax
basis in the notes. Subject to a de minimis exception, these provisions
generally require a U.S. Holder who acquires notes at a market discount to
treat as ordinary income any gain recognized on the disposition of such notes
to the extent of the "accrued market discount" on such notes at the time of
disposition, unless the holder elects to include accrued market discount in
income currently. This election to include market discount in income
currently, once made, applies to all market discount obligations acquired on
or after the first taxable year to which the election applies and may not be
revoked without the consent of the IRS. In general, market discount will be
treated as accruing on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the
notes at the time of acquisition, or, at the election of the holder, under a
constant yield method. A U.S. Holder who acquires notes at a market discount
and who does not elect to include accrued market discount in income currently
may be required to defer the deduction of a portion of the interest on any
indebtedness incurred or maintained to purchase or carry the notes until such
notes are disposed of in a taxable transaction. If a holder acquires notes
with market discount and receives our common stock upon conversion of such
notes, the amount of accrued market discount not previously included in income
with respect to the converted notes through the date of conversion will be
treated as ordinary income upon the disposition of the common stock.

   Under the President's recent budget proposal, accrual basis taxpayers could
be required to accrue market discount currently, subject to certain
limitations.


                                     S-18
<PAGE>

   Amortizable Premium

   A U.S. Holder who purchases a note at a premium over its stated principal
amount, plus accrued interest, generally may elect to amortize such premium
("Section 171 premium") from the purchase date to the note's maturity date
under a constant-yield method that reflects semiannual compounding based on
the note's payment period. Amortizable premium, however, will not include any
premium attributable to a note conversion feature. The premium attributable to
the conversion feature is the excess, if any, of the note's purchase price
over what the note's fair market value would be if there were no conversion
feature. Amortized Section 171 premium is treated as an offset to interest
income on a note and not as a separate deduction. The election to amortize a
premium on a constant yield method, once made, applies to all debt obligations
held or subsequently acquired by the electing U.S. holder on or after the
first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and may not
be revoked without the consent of the IRS.

</TABLE>

   The underwriters are offering the notes subject to their acceptance of the
notes from us and subject to prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides
that the obligation of the underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the
notes is subject to the approval of legal matters by their counsel and to
other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all the
notes (other than those covered by the over-allotment option described below)
if any are taken.

   The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the notes directly to
the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page and part
to certain dealers at a price that represents a concession not in excess of
1.8% of the principal amount of the notes. No underwriter may allow, and no
dealer may reallow, a concession to other dealers. After the initial offering
of the notes, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time
be varied by the underwriters.

   We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from
the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to an additional $45,000,000
principal amount of the notes at the public offering price set forth on the
cover page hereof, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The
underwriters may exercise such option solely for the purpose of covering over-
allotments, if any, made in connection with this offering.

   The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market
and will not be listed on any national securities exchange. The underwriters
have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the notes, as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The underwriters are not
obligated, however, to make a market in the notes and any such market making
may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the underwriter.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading
markets for, the notes.

   We and our executive officers and directors have agreed that, without the
prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated on behalf of the
underwriters, we will not, during the period ending 90 days after the date of
this prospectus supplement:

  .  offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
     purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option,
     right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of,
     directly or indirectly, any shares of common stock or any securities
     convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock; or

  .  enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in
     whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the
     common stock,

                                     S-20
<PAGE>

whether any such transaction described in either section above is to be
settled by delivery of common stock or such other securities, in cash or
otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply:

  .  in our case, to (i) the sale of the notes offered hereby or the issuance
     of the underlying securities upon conversion of the notes, (ii) the
     issuance by us of any shares of common stock upon the exercise of an
     option or warrant or the conversion of a security outstanding on the
     date of this prospectus supplement, or (iii) the grant or exercise of
     options to purchase common stock under our employee benefit plans or
     (iv) the sale of 1,400,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent
     offering; and

  .  in the case of our executive officers and directors, to (i) transactions
     relating to shares of common stock or other securities acquired in open
     market transactions after the completion of the offering and
     (ii) certain transfers of shares of common stock or any security
     convertible into common stock as a bona fide gift or gifts.

   In order to facilitate the offering of the notes, the underwriters may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price
of the notes or common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more
notes than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement,
creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no
greater than the number of notes available for purchase by the underwriters
under the over allotment option. The underwriters can close out a covered
short sale by exercising the over allotment option or purchasing notes in the
open market. In determining the source of notes to close out a covered short
sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market
price of notes compared to the price available under the over allotment
option. The underwriters may also sell notes in excess of the over allotment
option, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any
naked short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A naked short
position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that
there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market
after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the
offering. As an additional means of facilitating the offering, the
underwriters may bid for, and purchase, notes in the open market to stabilize
the price of the notes. The underwriting syndicate may also reclaim selling
concessions allowed to an underwriter or a dealer for distributing the notes
in the offering, if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed notes to
cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the common stock.
These activities may raise or maintain the market price of the notes above
independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price
of the notes. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities,
and may end any of these activities at any time.

   A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web sites
maintained by one or more underwriters. The underwriters may agree to allocate
a number of shares to underwriters for sale to their online brokerage account
holders. Internet distribution will be allocated by the lead manager to
underwriters that may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other
allocations.

   In the ordinary course of their respective business, certain of the
underwriters and/or affiliates of the underwriters have engaged, or may in the
future engage, in investment banking, investment advisory and/or commercial
banking transactions with us and our affiliates for which customary
compensation has been, and will be, received.

   We have also agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or to contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to
make in respect of any such liabilities.

   Due to the fact that one of the representatives of the underwriters was
organized within the last three years, we are providing the following
information. Thomas Weisel Partners LLC, one of the representatives of the
underwriters, was organized and registered as a broker-dealer in December
1998. Since December 1998, Thomas Weisel Partners LLC has been named as a lead
or co-manager of, or as a syndicate member in, numerous public offerings of
equity securities. Thomas Weisel Partners LLC does not have any material
relationship with us or any of our officers, directors or other controlling
persons.

Overview

  We design, develop and market graphics processors and related software for
personal computers and digital entertainment platforms. We provide a "top-to-
bottom" family of award-winning performance 3D graphics processors and graphics
processing units, or GPUs, that set the standard for performance, quality and
features for a broad range of desktop PCs, from professional workstations to
low-cost PCs. Our 3D graphics processors are used in a wide variety of
applications, including games, business productivity, the Internet and
industrial design. Our graphics processors were the first to incorporate a 128-
bit multi-texturing graphics architecture designed to deliver to users of our
products a highly immersive, interactive 3D experience with compelling visual
quality, realistic imagery and motion, stunning effects and complex object and
scene interaction at real-time frame rates. The NVIDIA TNT2, TNT2 M64 and Vanta
graphics processors deliver high performance 3D and 2D graphics at affordable
prices, making them the graphics hardware of choice for a wide range of
applications for both consumer and commercial use. Our graphics processors are
designed to be architecturally compatible backward and forward between
generations, giving our OEM customers and end users a low cost of ownership. We
are recognized for developing the world's first GPU, the GeForce 256, which
incorporates independent hardware transform and lighting processing units along
with a complete rendering pipeline into a single-chip architecture. Our current
GPUs, the GeForce2 Ultra, the GeForce2 GTS, the GeForce2 MX, the NVIDIA Quadro2
Pro and the Quadro2 MXR, process hundreds of billions of operations per second
and increase the PC's ability to render high-definition 3D scenes in real-time.
Our GPU family provides superior processing and rendering power at competitive
prices and is architected to deliver the maximum performance from industry
standards such as Microsoft's Direct3D API and SGI's OpenGL API on Windows 98,
Windows 2000 and Linux platforms. We have also developed an integrated core
logic/graphics chipset called Aladdin TNT2 through a partnership with Acer
Laboratories, Inc., or ALi, one of the leading suppliers of core logic chipsets
for the PC. The Aladdin TNT2 chipset brings NVIDIA-class graphics performance
and quality to the value PC segment.

  We designed our GPUs and graphics processors to enable PC OEMs and add-in
board manufacturers to build award-winning state-of-the-art interactive 3D
graphics capability while maintaining affordable prices. We believe that a PC's
interactive 3D graphics capability represents one of the primary means by which
users differentiate among various systems. PC users today can easily
differentiate the quality of graphics and prefer personal computers that
provide a superior visual experience. We believe that by developing 3D graphics
solutions that provide superior performance and address the key requirements of
the PC market, we will accelerate the adoption of 3D graphics throughout this
market.

  Our products currently are designed into products offered by virtually every
leading branded PC OEM, including Acer, Compaq, Dell, eMachines, Fujitsu-
Siemens, Gateway, HP, IBM, micronpc.com, NEC, Packard Bell NEC, SGI and Sony,
as well as leading CEMs, including Celestica, Intel, Mitac, MSI, SCI and
VisionTek, and leading add-in board manufacturers, including ASUSTek, Canopus,
Creative, ELSA and Guillemot. The benefits and performance of the NVIDIA family
of 3D graphics processors have received significant industry validation and
have enabled us and our customers to win more than 600 industry awards,
including over 20 "Editors' Choice" awards from PC Magazine during the last
three years, Edge Magazine's 1999 "Hardware Innovation of the Year,"
MicroDesign Research's "1999 Analyst's Choice for Best 3D Processor" and, in
the workstation market, Pro/E the Magazine's "Platinum Award."

reject all or part of any proposed purchase of securities. If we do offer
securities through agents or underwriters, we will include in the applicable
prospectus supplement:

  .  the names of those agents or underwriters;

  .  applicable fees, discounts and commissions to be paid to them; and

  .  the net proceeds to us.

  Common Stock. We may issue shares of our common stock, from time to time.
Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders, except those matters that are submitted
solely to a vote of the holders of preferred stock. Subject to any preferences
of outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of common stock are entitled
to dividends when and if declared by the board of directors.

  Debt Securities. We may offer debt securities from time to time, in one or
more series, as either senior or subordinated debt or as senior or subordinated
convertible debt. The senior debt securities will rank equally with all of our
other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The subordinated debt securities will
be subordinate and junior in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner
described in the instrument governing the debt, to all of our senior
indebtedness. Convertible debt securities will be convertible into our common
stock. Conversion may be mandatory or at your option, and would be at
prescribed conversion rates.

  The debt securities will be issued under indentures between us and Chase
Manhattan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association. In this
prospectus, we have summarized certain general features of the debt securities.
We urge you, however, to read the prospectus supplement related to the series
of debt securities being offered, as well as the complete indentures, which
contain the terms of the debt securities. The indentures have been filed as
exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part or
will be incorporated by reference from reports we file with the SEC.

                                 RISK FACTORS

  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this
prospectus, including the risk factors listed below. Any of these risks could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the price
of the debt securities and the common stock. The prospectus supplement
applicable to each type or series of securities also will contain a discussion
of risks applicable to an investment in our company and to the particular
types of securities that we are offering under that supplement. Prior to
making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully
consider the specific factors discussed under the caption "Risk Factors" in
both the prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, together with
all of the other information contained in this prospectus and the prospectus
supplement or appearing or incorporated by reference in the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part.

  Keep these risk factors in mind when you read "forward-looking" statements
elsewhere in this prospectus and in the applicable prospectus supplements and
in the documents incorporated by reference. Such statements relate to our
expectations about future events and time periods. Generally, the words
"anticipate," "expect," "intend" and similar expressions identify forward-
looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, and future events and circumstances could differ significantly
from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.

   Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate.

  Many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and
our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular
period. It is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and
profits or losses. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of
operations will be affected by a variety of factors that could adversely
affect our revenue, gross profit and results of operations.

  Factors that have affected our results of operations in the past, and are
likely to affect our results of operations in the future, include the
following:

  .  demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers'
     products;

  .  the successful development and volume production of next-generation
     products;

  .  new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors;

  .  our ability to introduce new products in accordance with OEM design
     requirements and design cycles;

  .  changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the
     introduction of our customers' products;

  .  fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or
     manufacturing yields;

  .  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling
     prices;

  .  rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality
     issues;

  .  the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders;

  .  the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic
     relationship;

  .  seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC market;

  .  substantial disruption in our suppliers' operations, either as a result
     of a natural disaster, equipment failure or other cause;

  .  supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components
     incorporated into our customers' products, including memory devices;

                                       4
<PAGE>

  .  our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;

  .  legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property;

  .bad debt write-offs;

  .  unexpected inventory write-downs; and

  .  introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster
     generations of processors and controllers.

  Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from
achieving our expected future revenue or net income.

  Because most operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, we
may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate
for any unexpected sales shortfall. We may be required to reduce prices in
response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. If new
competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other
competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than
anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts, our
business could suffer. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an
indication of future performance. In addition, the results of any quarterly
period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year.

   Our 3D graphics solution may not continue to be accepted by the PC market.

  Our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our 3D
graphics processors for high performance 3D graphics in PC applications. The
market for 3D graphics processors has been characterized by unpredictable and
sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often caused by the
publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in dynamic
random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of
add-in boards, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new
technology and product introductions. Only a small number of products have
achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance, if achieved, is
difficult to sustain due to intense competition. Since we have no other
product line, our business would suffer if for any reason our current or
future 3D graphics processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance
in the PC market. If we are unable to complete the timely development of or
successfully and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet
the requirements of the PC market, our business would be harmed.

   Our integrated graphics product may not be accepted by the PC market.

  We expect that integrated graphics chipset products will become an
increasing part of the lower cost segment of the PC graphics market. We have
only recently introduced a 3D graphics processor targeted at this segment, as
part of a joint development effort with ALi. If this product is not
competitive in this segment and the integrated chipset segment continues to
account for an increasing percentage of the units sold in the PC market, our
business may suffer.

   We need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order
to succeed.

  Our business will depend to a significant extent on our ability to
successfully develop new products for the 3D graphics market. Our add-in board
manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new system
configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and fall
design cycles. Accordingly, our existing products must have competitive
performance levels or we must introduce new products on a timely basis with
such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system
configurations. This requires that we do the following:

  .  anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand;

                                       5
<PAGE>

  .  incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the
     exacting design requirements of PC OEMs and add-in board manufacturers
     or CEMs;

  .  price our products competitively; and

  .  introduce the products to the market within the limited window for PC
     OEM and add-in board manufacturers.

  As a result, we believe that significant expenditures for research and
development will continue to be required in the future. The success of new
product introductions will depend on several factors, including the following:

  .  proper new product definition;

  .  timely completion and introduction of new product designs;

  .  the ability of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, our
     primary manufacturer, WaferTech LLC, a joint venture controlled by TSMC,
     and any additional third-party manufacturers to effectively manufacture
     our new products in a timely manner;

  .  the quality of any new products;

  .  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors;

  .  market acceptance of our and our customers' products; and

  .  availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of
     memory products.

  Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process
technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-
party foundries. Use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial
yield problems. New products that we introduce may not incorporate the
features and functionality demanded by PC OEMs, add-in board manufacturers and
consumers of 3D graphics. In addition, we may not successfully develop or
introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to
meet both the PC OEMs' design cycles and market demand. We have in the past
experienced delays in the development of some new products. Our failure to
successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance for new 3D
graphics products would harm our business.

  Our failure to identify new product opportunities or to develop new products
could harm business.

  As markets for our 3D graphics processors develop and competition increases,
we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and
average selling prices will continue to decline. In particular, we expect
average selling prices and gross margins for our 3D graphics processors to
decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases. As a result, we
will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to
maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins. In order for our 3D
graphics processors to achieve high volumes, leading PC OEMs and add-in board
manufacturers must select our 3D graphics processor for design into their
products and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell
them. We may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or
to develop and bring to market in a timely fashion any new products. In
addition, we cannot guarantee that any new products we develop will be
selected for design into PC OEMs' and add-in board manufacturers' products,
that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products
will be sold. As the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process
for products increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience
problems with the performance of products and that there will be delays in the
development, introduction or volume shipment of our products. We may
experience difficulties related to the production of current or future
products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new
products we develop. In addition, we may be unable to successfully manage the
production transition risks with respect to future products. Failure to
achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product
enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices, reduced
margins, and reduced demand for products or loss of market share. In addition,

                                       6
<PAGE>

technologies developed by others may render our 3D graphics products non-
competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory, either of
which would harm our business.

   We rely on third-party vendors to supply us tools for the development of
our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop
these products.

  In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we
rely on third-party software development tools. While we currently are not
dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools, some or all of
these tools may not be readily available in the future. For example, we have
experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of
the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate
the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design
requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater
functionality from 3D graphics products in the future may exceed the
capabilities of the software development tools available to us. If the
software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce
designs that meet consumer demands, our business could suffer.

   Our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial
costs to us.

  The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and
pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions, which has resulted in
protracted and expensive litigation. The 3D graphics market in particular has
been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property
positions, and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive
intellectual property positions. In addition, from time to time we receive
notices alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property
rights owned by third parties. We expect that, as the number of issued
hardware and software patents increases, and as competition in our markets
intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims will
increase. If infringement claims are made against us, we may seek licenses
under the claimant's patents or other intellectual property rights. However,
licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us. The failure
to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause
us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of
products. Furthermore, we may initiate claims or litigation against third
parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the
validity of our proprietary rights. We have agreed to indemnify certain
customers for claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products.
Litigation by or against us or our customers concerning infringement would
likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our
technical and management personnel, whether or not the litigation results in a
favorable determination for us.

   We are subject to a patent infringement lawsuit and could be subject to
future lawsuits that could divert our resources and result in the payment of
substantial damages.

  On September 21, 1998, 3Dfx Interactive, Inc. filed a patent infringement
suit against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California alleging infringement of a 3Dfx patent. On March 2, 1999, 3Dfx
added a second patent to the suit and on May 24, 1999, 3Dfx added a third
patent to the suit. The amended complaint alleges that our RIVA TNT, RIVA TNT2
and RIVA TNT2 Ultra products infringe the patents in suit and seeks
unspecified compensatory and trebled damages and attorneys' fees. Our current
generation of products is not identified as infringing any of the patents in
suit. We have filed an answer and counter-claims asserting that the patents in
suit are invalid and not infringed. These assertions are supported by our
investigations to date and an opinion from our patent counsel in this suit.
The District Court has recently ruled on claims construction issues, but a
trial date has not yet been set. We have and will continue to defend
vigorously this suit. The litigation with 3Dfx has resulted, and we expect
that the 3Dfx litigation will continue to result, in significant legal
expenses, whether or not the litigation results in a favorable determination
for us. In the event of an adverse result in the 3Dfx suit, we might be
required to do one or more of the following:

  .  pay substantial damages (including treble damages);

  .  permanently cease the manufacture and sale of any of the infringing
     products;

                                       7
<PAGE>

  .  expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products; or

  .  obtain a license from 3Dfx for infringing products.

  On August 28, 2000, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against 3Dfx in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The
lawsuit alleges that 3Dfx's graphics chip and card products, which are used to
accelerate 3D graphics on personal computers, infringe five of our patents and
seeks an injunction restraining 3Dfx from manufacturing, selling or importing
infringing graphics chip and card products including its Voodoo 3, Voodoo 4
and Voodoo 5 and VSA-100 family of products, as well as monetary damages. The
matter is in its earliest stages, discovery has not yet begun and no trial
date has been set.

  We have in the past been subject to patent infringement suits with SGI and
S3 Incorporated, both of which were settled and resulted in cross-licenses
and, in the case of SGI, payments by us. In addition, we may be subject to
patent infringement suits brought by other parties in the future. For example,
we have received correspondence from Rambus Inc. indicating that it believes
our products infringe certain patents held by Rambus and requesting that we
agree to certain licensing terms, including royalty payments. We believe the
Rambus patents are invalid, not infringed and unenforceable. Although we
currently are having discussions with Rambus regarding potential business
alternatives to Rambus' proposed licensing terms, we cannot guarantee that we
will be able to reach a satisfactory agreement with Rambus. If we are unable
to do so, Rambus may sue us for patent infringement at any time.

  We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property.

  We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade
secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing
arrangements to protect our intellectual property. We own 33 issued United
States patents, and have 46 United States patent applications pending. Our
issued patents have expiration dates from April 2015 to April 2018. Our issued
patents and pending patent applications relate to technology developed by us
in connection with the development of our 3D graphics processors. Our pending
patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In
addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or
may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents of others may
harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our
trade secrets or intellectual property, or disclose our intellectual property
or trade secrets. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property
could harm our business. We have licensed technology from third parties for
incorporation in our graphics processors, and expect to continue to enter into
license agreements for future products. These licenses may result in royalty
payments to third parties, the cross-license of technology by us or payment of
other consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially
reasonable terms, our business could suffer.

  Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business.

  Our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins, which
entails having our existing and future products chosen as the 3D graphics
processors for hardware components or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs and
motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. Our add-in board manufacturers and
major OEM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as
twice per year, generally based on spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly,
our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must
timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order
to be included in new system configurations. Our failure to achieve one or
more design wins would harm our business. The process of being qualified for
inclusion in a PC OEM's product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a
cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature, which also
could harm our business.

  Our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to
identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated
changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with
products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers,
including Intel and Microsoft. This would require us to invest significant
time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant
standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry
standards for a significant period of time, our ability to achieve design wins
could suffer.

                                       8

  We are dependent on the PC market, which may not continue to grow.

  In fiscal 2000, we derived all of our revenue from the sale of products for
use in PCs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we derived most of our
revenue from the sale of products for use in the entire desktop PC market,
from professional workstations to low-cost PCs. We expect to continue to
derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in PCs
in the next several years. The PC market is characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions
and significant price competition. These factors result in short product life
cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the life of a
specific product. Although the PC market has grown substantially in recent
years, this growth may not continue. A reduction in sales of PCs, or a
reduction in the growth rate of PC sales, would likely reduce demand for our
products. Moreover, changes in demand could be large and sudden. Since PC
manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth,
they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have
incorrectly forecast product transitions. In these cases, PC manufacturers may
abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from
suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed. Any reduction
in the demand for PCs generally, or for a particular product that incorporates
our 3D graphic processors, could harm our business.

  The acceptance of next generation products in business PC 3D graphics may
not continue to develop.

  Our success will depend in part upon the demand for performance 3D graphics
for business PC applications. The market for performance 3D graphics on
business PCs has only recently begun to emerge and is dependent on the future
development of, and substantial end-user and OEM demand for, 3D graphics
functionality. As a result, the market for business PC 3D graphics computing
may not continue to develop or may not grow at a rate sufficient to support
our business. The development of the market for performance 3D graphics on
business PCs will in turn depend on the development and availability of a
large number of business PC software applications that support or take
advantage of performance 3D graphics capabilities. Currently there are only a
limited number of software applications like this, most of which are games,
and a broader base of software applications may not develop in the near term
or at all. Consequently, a broad market for full function performance 3D
graphics on business PCs may not develop. Our business prospects will suffer
if the market for business PC 3D graphics fails to develop or develops more
slowly than expected.

  We are dependent on a small number of customers and we are subject to order
and shipment uncertainties.

  We have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly
concentrated. We primarily sell our products to add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers and CEMs, which incorporate graphics products in the boards they
sell to PC OEMs. Sales to add-in board manufacturers and CEMs are primarily
dependent on achieving design wins with leading PC OEMs. The number of add-in
board manufacturers and CEMs and leading PC OEMs is limited. We expect that a
small number of add-in board manufacturers and CEMs directly, and a small
number of PC OEMs indirectly, will continue to account for a substantial
portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our business
could be harmed by the loss of business from PC OEMs or add-in board
manufacturers and CEMs. In addition, revenue from add-in board manufacturers,
motherboard manufacturers, CEMs and PC OEMs that have directly or indirectly
accounted for significant revenue in past periods, individually or as a group,
may not continue, or may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future
period.

  Our business may be harmed by instability in Asia due to the concentration
of customers who are located or have substantial operations in Asia, including
Taiwan. The People's Republic of China and Taiwan have in the past experienced
and currently are experiencing strained relations. A worsening of these
relations or the development of hostilities between the two could result in
disruptions in Taiwan and possibly other areas of Asia, which could harm our
business. While we believe political instability in Asia has not adversely
affected our business, because of our reliance on companies with operations in
Asia, continued economic and political instability in Asia might harm us.

  We may be unable to manage our growth and, as a result, may be unable to
successfully implement our strategy.

  Our rapid growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a
significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. As
of July 30, 2000, we had 529 employees as compared to 392 employees as of
January 30, 2000. We expect that the number of our employees will increase
substantially over the next 12 months. Our future growth, if any, will depend
on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and
management information and control systems on a timely basis, as well as our
ability to maintain effective cost controls. Further, we will be required to
manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties.
Our systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our
operations and our management may be unable to achieve the rapid execution
necessary to successfully implement our strategy.

  We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm
our business.

  Our performance will be substantially dependent on the performance of our
executive officers and key employees. None of our officers or employees is
bound by an employment agreement, and our relationships with these officers
and employees are, therefore, at will. We do not have "key person" life
insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of
our executive officers, technical personnel or other key employees,
particularly Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would
harm our business. Our success will depend on our ability to identify, hire,
train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Our
failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel
would harm our business.

  We depend on third-party fabrication to produce our products.

  We do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do
not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Our products require wafers
manufactured with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques. We
utilize TSMC and WaferTech to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize
independent contractors to perform assembly, test and packaging. We depend on
these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity
sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at
acceptable manufacturing yields, and to deliver those products to us on a
timely basis. These manufacturers may be unable to meet our near-term or long-
term manufacturing requirements. We obtain manufacturing services on a
purchase order basis and TSMC has no obligation to provide us with any
specified minimum quantities of product. TSMC fabricates wafers for other
companies, including certain of our competitors, and could choose to
prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on
short notice. Because the lead time needed to establish a strategic
relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters, there
is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product.
We believe that long-term market acceptance for our products will depend on
reliable relationships with TSMC and any other manufacturers used by us to
ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.

  In September 1999, a significant earthquake in Taiwan contributed to a
temporary shortage of graphics processors in the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 2000. Because of our reliance on TSMC, our business may be harmed by
political instability in Taiwan, including the worsening of the strained
relations between The People's Republic of China and Taiwan. Furthermore, any
substantial disruption in our suppliers' operations, either as a result of a
natural disaster, political unrest, economic instability, equipment failure or
other cause, could harm our business.

  We are dependent primarily on TSMC and we expect in the future to continue
to be dependent upon third-party manufacturers to do the following:

  .  produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing
     yields;

  .  deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing
     subcontractors on a timely basis; and

  .  allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to
     meet our needs.

                                      10
<PAGE>

  Our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total
production capacity of TSMC. Although our products are designed using TSMC's
process design rules, TSMC may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable
yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis and/or at
an acceptable cost. Additionally, TSMC may not continue to devote resources to
the production of our products, or to advance the process design technologies
on which the manufacturing of our products is based. Any difficulties like
these would harm our business.

  Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields would reduce our product
supply and harm our business.

  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design,
which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is
proprietary to the manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either
design or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively
determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and
tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are
used. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the
production process, and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation
by and communication between the manufacturer and us.

  The risk of low yields is compounded by the offshore location of most of our
manufacturers, increasing the effort and time required to identify,
communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Because of our
potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our
manufacturers, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an
increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product
supply among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships
as well as revenue and gross profit. Our wafer manufacturers may be unable to
achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. Our
inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm
our business. We also face the risk of product recalls or product returns
resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during
the manufacturing and testing process. In the event of a significant number of
product returns due to a defect or recall, our business could suffer.

  Failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect
our ability to compete effectively.

  Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process
technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-
party foundries. Use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial
yield problems. Manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change
and require significant expenditures for research and development. We
continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process
technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. We have
migrated to the .18 micron technology with the GeForce2 GTS GPUs, and we
believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries
will be important to our competitive position. Other companies in the industry
have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes and,
consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and
increased expense levels. We may experience similar difficulties and the
corresponding negative effects. Moreover, we are dependent on our
relationships with our third-party manufacturers to migrate to smaller
geometry processes successfully. We may be unable to migrate to new
manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely basis.

  The 3D graphics industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to
compete.

  The market for 3D graphics processors for PCs in which we compete is
intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change,
evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe
that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth
of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-
forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing
capabilities, price of graphics processors and total system costs of add-in
boards and motherboards. We expect competition to increase both from existing
competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than
our 3D graphics processors or may provide better performance or additional
features not provided by our products.

                                      11

  Our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend
to provide 3D graphics solutions for the PC market. Our competitors include
the following:

  .  suppliers of graphics add-in boards that utilize their internally
     developed graphics chips, such as ATI Technologies Inc. and Matrox
     Electronics Systems Ltd.;

  .  suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate 2D and 3D
     graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as
     Intel, Silicon Integrated Systems and Via Technologies;

  .  companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market and
     provide high end 3D solutions for PCs and workstations, including 3Dlabs
     Inc., SGI and Evans and Sutherland Computer Corporation; and

  .  companies that focus on the video game market, such as 3Dfx and
     VideoLogic Group plc.

  If and to the extent we offer products outside of the 3D graphics processor
market, we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well
as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately
predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter.

  We may compete with Intel in the integrated low-cost chipset market.

  In June 2000, Intel began shipping the Intel 815 and 815e 3D graphics
chipsets that are targeted at the low-cost PC market. Intel has significantly
greater resources than we do, and our products may not compete effectively
against future products introduced by Intel. In addition, we may be unable to
compete effectively against Intel or Intel may introduce additional products
that are competitive with our products in either performance or price or both.
We expect Intel to continue to do the following:

  .  invest heavily in research and development and new manufacturing
     facilities;

  .  maintain its position as the largest manufacturer of PC microprocessors;

  .  increasingly dominate the PC platform; and

  .  promote its product offerings through advertising campaigns designed to
     engender brand loyalty among PC users.

  Intel may in the future develop graphics add-in cards or graphics-enabled
motherboards that could directly compete with graphics add-in cards or
graphics-enabled motherboards based on our product. In addition, due to the
widespread industry acceptance of Intel's microprocessor architecture and
interface architecture, including its AGP, and Intel's intellectual property
position with respect to such architecture, Intel exercises significant
influence over the PC industry generally. Any significant modifications by
Intel to the AGP, the microprocessor or core logic components or other aspects
of the PC microprocessor architecture could result in incompatibility with our
technology, which would harm our business. In addition, any delay in the
public release of information relating to modifications like this could harm
our business.

  We are dependent on third parties for assembly and testing of our products.

  Our graphics processors are assembled and tested by Advance Semiconductor
Engineering, Inc., ChipPAC Incorporated and Siliconware Precision Industries
Company Ltd., all of which are based in Asia. Because we rely on Asian
assembly and test subcontractors, our business may be harmed by political
instability in Asia, including the worsening of the strained relations between
The People's Republic of China and Taiwan. We do not have long-term agreements
with any of these subcontractors. As a result of our dependence on third-party
subcontractors for assembly and testing of our products, we do not directly
control product delivery schedules or product quality. Any product shortages
or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture,
assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business. Due to the
amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers, we could
experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we

                                      12
<PAGE>

are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our
products or components. Any delays in delivery of our products could harm our
business.

  We are subject to risks associated with product defects and
incompatibilities.

  Products as complex as ours may contain defects or failures when introduced
or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We
have in the past discovered software defects and incompatibilities with
customers' hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or
lost revenue to correct any new defects in the future. Errors in new products
or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of
market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. Our products typically
go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production
and distribution. As a result, our products may contain defects or flaws that
are undetected prior to volume production and distribution. The widespread
production and distribution of defective products could harm our business.

  We are subject to risks associated with international operations.

  Our reliance on foreign third-party manufacturing, assembly and testing
operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting
business outside of the United States, including the following:

  .  unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory
     requirements;

  .  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for
     certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and
     restrictions;

  .  longer payment cycles;

  .  imposition of additional taxes and penalties;

  .  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and

  .  other factors beyond our control.

  We also are subject to general political risks in connection with our
international trade relationships. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including
various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual
property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This
makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely.
Currently, all of our arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for
pricing and payment in U.S. dollars, and to date we have not engaged in any
currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations
in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

  The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature.

  The semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by the
following factors:

  .  rapid technological change;

  .  cyclical market patterns;

  .  significant average selling price erosion;

  .  fluctuating inventory levels;

  .  alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints; and

  .  variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant
     expenditures for capital equipment and product development.

  In addition, the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at
various times, characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated
erosion of average selling prices. We may experience substantial period-to-
period fluctuations in results of operations due to general semiconductor
industry conditions.

  Failure in implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could
adversely affect our operations.

  In December 1999, we began the implementation of an SAP A.G. system as our
enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to replace our information
systems in business, finance, operations and service. The first phase of the
implementation was successfully completed in June 2000 and our operations are
fully functioning under the new ERP system. Future phases of the
implementation are expected to occur throughout fiscal 2001. We are heavily
dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems to conduct our
business. System failure or malfunctioning may result in disruptions of
operations and inability to process transactions. Our results of operations
and financial position could be adversely affected if we encounter unforseen
problems with respect to system operations or future implementation.

  Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our
agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.

  Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our
outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:

  .  the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred
     stock without prior stockholder approval;

  .  the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent;

  .  a classified board of directors; and

  .  advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder
     proposals.

  On March 5, 2000, we entered into a licensing and development agreement with
Microsoft that included a grant to Microsoft of first and last rights of
refusal over any offer we receive to purchase 30% or more of the outstanding
shares of our common stock. This provision could also delay or prevent a
change in control of NVIDIA.

  We are subject to risks associated with interest rate and foreign exchange
rate fluctuation.

  The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal
while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from the investments
without significantly increasing risk. To minimize potential loss arising from
adverse changes in interest rates, we maintain a portfolio of cash and cash
equivalents primarily in highly rated domestic money market funds. In general,
money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on
such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.

  We consider our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
minimal. Currently, all of our arrangements with third-party manufacturers
provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars, and therefore are not subject
to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not engaged in any currency
hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

                          FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

  This prospectus contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, that are based on our current expectations about our
company and our industry. We use words such as "expect," "anticipate,"
"estimate," "believe," "intend," "plan" and other similar expressions to
identify some forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking
statements include these words. All our forward-looking statements involve
risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from our
expectations and from the results expressed in or implied by these forward-
looking statements. The section captioned "Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" that appears in our annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2000, our quarterly report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2000 and our quarterly report on Form 10-
Q for the quarter ended July 30, 2000, as well as the section captioned "Risk
Factors" in this prospectus and that will appear in prospectus supplements
accompanying this prospectus describe some, but not necessarily all, of the
factors that could cause these differences. We urge you to read those sections
carefully. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to
publicly update any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new
information becomes available or other events occur in the future.

                      RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

  Our earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges in each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1997. Additional earnings of $6.4
million, $3.1 million and $3.6 million were necessary to provide a 1:1
coverage ratio for December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. For the
purpose of these calculations, "earnings" consist of income before taxes, plus
fixed charges, and "fixed charges" consist of interest expense incurred and
the portion of rental expense deemed by us to be representative of the
interest factor of rental payments under leases.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our
financial statements and notes thereto. Our fiscal years ended on December 31
from 1993 to 1997. Effective January 31, 1998, we changed our fiscal year-end
financial reporting period to a 52- or 53- week year ending on the last Sunday
in January. We elected not to restate the previous reporting periods ending
December 31. As a result, the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 1999 (year
ended January 31, 1999) are 12- and 14-week periods, respectively, with the
remaining quarters being 13-week periods. All four quarters of fiscal 2000
(year ended January 30, 2000) and the first two quarters of fiscal 2001 (year
ending January 28, 2001) are 13-week periods.

Overview

  We design, develop and market graphics processors and related software for
personal computers and digital entertainment platforms. We provide a "top-to-
bottom" family of award-winning 3D graphics processors and GPUs that set the
standard for performance, quality and features for a broad range of desktop
PCs, from professional workstations to low-cost PCs. Our 3D graphics
processors are used in a wide variety of applications, including games,
business productivity, the Internet and industrial design. Our graphics
processors were the first to incorporate a 128-bit multi-texturing graphics
architecture designed to deliver to users of our products a highly immersive,
interactive 3D experience with compelling visual quality, realistic imagery
and motion stunning effects and complex object and scene interaction at real-
time frame rates. The NVIDIA TNT2, TNT2 M64 and Vanta graphics processors
deliver high performance 3D and 2D graphics at affordable prices, making them
the graphics hardware of choice for a wide range of applications for both
consumer and commercial use. Our graphics processors are designed to be
architecturally compatible backward and forward between generations, giving
our OEM customers and end users a low cost of ownership. We are recognized for
developing the world's first GPU, the GeForce 256, which incorporates
independent hardware transform and lighting processing units along with a
complete rendering pipeline into a single-chip architecture. Our current GPUs,
the GeForce2 Ultra, the GeForce2 GTS, the GeForce2 MX, the NVIDIA Quadro2 Pro
and the Quadro2 MXR, process hundreds of billions of operations per second and
increase the PC's ability to render high-definition 3D scenes in real-time.
Our GPU family provides superior processing and rendering power at competitive
prices and is architected to deliver the maximum performance from industry
standards such as Microsoft's Direct3D API and SGI's OpenGL API on Windows 98,
Windows 2000 and Linux platforms. We have also developed an integrated core
logic/graphics chipset called Aladdin TNT2 through a partnership with ALi, one
of the leading suppliers of core logic chipsets for the PC. The Aladdin TNT2
chipset brings NVIDIA-class graphics performance and quality to the value PC
segment.

  We recognize product sales revenue upon shipment, net of appropriate
allowances. Our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of
sales and related gross profit until the distributors resell the product.
Royalty revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to the
licensee's customers. Currently, all of our product sales and our arrangements
with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S.
dollars. We have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities,
although we may do so in the future. Since we have no other product line, our
business would suffer if for any reason our graphics processors do not achieve
widespread acceptance in the PC market.

  A majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers and sales
are highly concentrated. We sell graphics processors to add-in board and
motherboard manufacturers, primarily ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Creative
Technology Ltd., ELSA AG, and Guillemot Corporation and contract electronics
manufacturers or CEMs, including Celestica Hong Kong Ltd., Mitac International
Corporation, Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., or MSI, SCI Systems, Inc. and
VisionTek, Inc. These manufacturers incorporate our processors in the boards
they sell to PC OEMs, retail outlets and systems integrators. The average
selling prices for our products, as well as our customers' products, vary by
distribution channel. For the first half of fiscal 2001, sales to Edom
accounted for 22%, and sales to Celestica accounted for 10% of our total
revenue. For the first half of fiscal 2000, sales to Diamond Multimedia
Systems, Inc. accounted for 25%, sales to Edom accounted for 16%, and sales to
Creative accounted for 18% of our total revenue. Diamond is no longer one of
our significant customers following its

                                      18
<PAGE>

acquisition by S3 Incorporated in October 1999. The number of potential
customers for our products is limited, and we expect sales to be concentrated
to a few major customers for the foreseeable future.

  As markets for our 3D graphics processors develop and competition increases,
we anticipate that product life cycles in the high end will remain short and
average selling prices will continue to decline. In particular, average
selling prices and gross margins are expected to decline as each product
matures. Our add-in board manufacturers and major OEM customers typically
introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year for the high
end, typically based on spring and fall design cycles. In order to maintain
average selling prices and gross margins, our existing and new products must
achieve competitive performance levels to be designed into new system
configurations and must be produced at low costs, in sufficient volumes and on
a timely basis, especially with respect to our new products.

  We currently utilize TSMC, our primary manufacturer, and WaferTech LLC (a
joint venture controlled by TSMC) to produce semiconductor wafers, and utilize
independent contractors to perform assembly, test and packaging. We depend on
these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity
sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at
acceptable manufacturing yields, and to deliver those products to us on a
timely basis. These manufacturers may not always be able to meet our near-term
or long-term manufacturing requirements. Yields or product performance could
suffer due to difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product
design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of a new
manufacturer. The level of finished goods inventory we maintain may fluctuate
and therefore a manufacturing disruption experienced by these manufacturers
would impact the production of our products, which could harm our business. In
addition, as the complexity of our products and the accompanying manufacturing
process increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience
problems with the performance of new products and that there will be yield
problems or other delays in the development or introduction of these products.

  Substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders
rather than long-term agreements. As a result, we may commit resources to the
production of products without having received advance purchase commitments
from customers. Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted
significant resources could harm our business. In addition, cancellation or
deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which
could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund
operations. We may build memory and component inventories during periods of
anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly
to major OEMs. We could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be
required to take corresponding write-downs if growth slows or if we
incorrectly forecast product demand. A reduction in demand could negatively
impact our gross margins and financial results. Product returns or delays or
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant
charges against income, which could harm our business.

</TABLE>

 Six Months Ended July 30, 2000 and August 1, 1999

  Revenue

  Revenue of $318.9 million for the first half of fiscal 2001 grew 114% over
the first half of fiscal 2000. The growth was primarily the result of
increased sales of our RIVA TNT2 and GeForce families of graphics processors
related to commercial desktop wins and the strong demand for our new products,
which have higher unit average selling prices. We began bundling double data
rate memories with GeForce products sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2000.
Revenue derived from the bundling of double data rate memories with a portion
of our GeForce products totaled $29.6 million in the first half of fiscal
2001. Revenue from sales outside of the U.S. represented 88% of total revenue
in the first half of fiscal 2001 and 58% in the first half of fiscal 2000. Our
international revenue increased 228% to $280.7 million for the first half of
fiscal 2001 from $85.7 million a year ago. This increase in revenue from sales
outside of the United States is primarily attributable to (i) expanded use of
CEMs and add-in board manufacturers located outside of the United States, and
(ii) increased demand for our products in the Asia Pacific and European
regions. Revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual countries
based on the location to which the products are initially shipped. The portion
of revenue derived from foreign CEMs and add-in board manufacturers
attributable to end customers in the U.S. is not separately disclosed.
Although we achieved substantial growth in product revenue from the first half
of fiscal 2000 to the same period in fiscal 2001, we do not expect to sustain
this rate of growth in future periods. In addition, we expect that the average
selling prices of our products will decline over the lives of the products.
The declines in average selling prices of 3D graphics processors generally may
also accelerate as the market develops and competition increases.

  Gross Profit

  Gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of
revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of semiconductors
purchased from contract manufacturers (including assembly, test and
packaging), manufacturing support costs (labor and overhead associated with
such purchases), inventory provisions and shipping costs. Our gross profit
margin in any period varies depending on the mix of types of graphics
processors sold. Gross profit increased 123% from the first half of fiscal
2000 to the same period of fiscal

                                      20
<PAGE>

2001, primarily due to significant increases in unit shipments and the
favorable impact of the higher margin GeForce families of graphics processing
units, partially offset by declining profit margins in our previous generation
products. We began the bundling of double data rate memories with our GeForce
processors in the second half of fiscal 2000. The inclusion of the double data
rate memories has reduced the gross margin percentage but has no incremental
impact on absolute margin dollars, as they are sold at cost. We expect to
continue bundling double data rate memories with some of our high-performance
products for at least the next six months. Although we achieved substantial
growth in gross profit and gross profit margin from the first half of fiscal
2000 to the same period of fiscal 2001, we do not expect to sustain these
rates of growth in future periods.

  Operating Expenses

  Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of
salaries and benefits, cost of development tools and software, costs of
prototypes of new products and consultant costs. Research and development
expenses increased by 94% from the first half of fiscal 2000 to the first half
of fiscal 2001, primarily due to additional personnel and related engineering
costs to support development of our next generation products, such as
depreciation charges incurred on capital expenditures and software license and
maintenance fees. We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial
resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to
increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased
complexity and the number of products under development. Research and
development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent
we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and our
level of revenue fluctuates.

  Sales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative
expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and bonuses, promotional
and advertising expenses, travel and entertainment expenses and legal and
accounting expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 73%
from the first half of fiscal 2000 to the first half of fiscal 2001, primarily
due to costs associated with additional personnel, commissions and bonuses on
sales of the RIVA TNT2 and GeForce families of graphics processors, and
increase in bad debt provision of $2.0 million related to one customer which
filed for bankruptcy. We expect sales and marketing expenses to remain
relatively constant in absolute dollars for the second half of fiscal 2001. As
we expand our operations, sales, general and administrative expenses are
likely to increase in absolute dollars. However, we do not expect significant
changes in these expenses as a percentage of revenue in future periods.

  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

  Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on cash and cash
equivalents. Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a
result of capital lease obligations. Interest expense declined slightly in the
first half of fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. Interest and other
income increased $4.6 million from the first half of fiscal 2000 to the same
period of fiscal 2001, due to higher average cash balances as a result of a
$200.0 million advance received from Microsoft in connection with our
agreement with Microsoft.

  Income Taxes


  We had an effective tax rate of 32% in the first half of fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2000. We anticipate our income tax rates for fiscal 2001 will be
relatively constant, but depend on the income tax attributable to foreign
operations and availability of research and experimentation credits.

  Stock-Based Compensation

  With respect to stock options granted to employees, we recorded deferred
compensation of $4.3 million in 1997 and $361,000 in the one month ended
January 31, 1998. These amounts are being amortized over the vesting period of
the individual options, generally four years. We amortized approximately
$85,000 in the first half of fiscal 2001 and $452,000 in the first half of
fiscal 2000. We anticipate total amortization of approximately $113,000 in
fiscal 2001.

                                      21
<PAGE>

 Fiscal Years Ended January 30, 2000, January 31, 1999 and December 31, 1997

  Revenue

  Product Revenue. Product revenue was $27.3 million in 1997, $151.4 million
in fiscal 1999 and $374.5 million in fiscal 2000. Product revenues increased
by 455% from 1997 to fiscal 1999 and by 147% from fiscal 1999 to 2000. The
growth in both periods was primarily the result of increased sales of our
graphics processors and the strong demand for new products at higher unit
average selling prices. Revenue derived from the bundling of double data rate
memories with a portion of our new GeForce 256 GPU totaled $22.1 million in
the second half of fiscal 2000. Revenue from sales outside of the U.S.
accounted for 72% and 24% of total revenue for fiscal 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Our international revenue increased 623% to $270.9 million in
fiscal 2000 from $37.4 million a year ago. This increase in revenue from sales
outside of the U.S. is primarily attributable to (i) the geographic limitation
of the worldwide license agreement with ST Microelectronics, Inc. with respect
to sales of the RIVA 128 and RIVA 128ZX graphics processors, which agreement
did not restrict the sales of the RIVA TNT, RIVA TNT2 and GeForce families of
processors in fiscal 2000, (ii) increased demand for our products in the Asia
Pacific and European regions, and (iii) expanded use of CEMs and add-in board
manufacturers located outside the U.S. Revenues by geographical region are
allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products
are initially shipped. The portion of revenue derived from foreign CEMs and
add-in board manufacturers that are attributable to end customers in the U.S.
is not separately disclosed. Substantially all of our revenue from product
sales in 1997 was derived from sales in the U.S.

  Royalty Revenue. ST has a worldwide license to sell the RIVA 128 and RIVA
128ZX graphics processors. Royalty revenue from sales by ST of the RIVA 128
graphics processor and a derivative of the RIVA 128ZX graphics processor
decreased to zero in fiscal 2000 due primarily to reduced sales of such
products and disputes with ST regarding payment. Royalty revenue from sales by
ST of the RIVA 128 graphics processor represented approximately 6% of our
total revenue in 1997, and royalty revenue from sales by ST of the RIVA 128
graphics processor and a derivative of the RIVA 128ZX graphics processor
represented 4% of our total revenue in fiscal 1999. We do not expect to record
or receive royalty revenue from ST in the future.

  Gross Profit

  Gross profit increased 187% from fiscal 1999 to 2000, primarily due to
significant increases in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher
margin RIVA TNT2 and GeForce graphics processors, partially offset by
declining profit margins in our older product families. From 1997 to fiscal
1999, gross profit grew by 520% primarily due to the sales of the higher
margin RIVA TNT graphics processor and reductions to costs of the RIVA 128
graphics processor. Excluding royalty revenue, gross margin on product revenue
was 22% in 1997, 28% in fiscal 1999 and 37% in fiscal 2000. In the second half
of fiscal 2000, the inclusion of the double data rate memories has reduced the
gross margin percentage but has no incremental impact on absolute margin
dollars as they are sold at cost.

  Operating Expenses

  Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased by 89%
from fiscal 1999 to 2000 and by 253% from 1997 to 1999, primarily due to
additional personnel and related engineering costs to support our next
generation products, such as depreciation charges incurred on capital
expenditures and software license and maintenance fees.

  As part of a strategic collaboration agreement with ST, we received contract
funding in support of research and development and marketing efforts for the
RIVA 128 and RIVA 128ZX graphics processors. Accordingly, we recorded
approximately $2.3 million and $2.3 million in 1997 and fiscal 1999,
respectively, as a reduction primarily to research and development, and to a
lesser extent, sales, general and administrative expenses. We were obligated
to provide continued development and support to ST through the end of calendar
1998.

  Sales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative
expenses increased 96% from fiscal 1999 to 2000, primarily due to additional
personnel and commissions and bonuses on sales of the RIVA TNT2

                                      22
<PAGE>

and GeForce 256 graphics processors, legal expenses associated with patent
litigation and costs of being a public company. From 1997 to fiscal 1999,
sales, general and administrative expenses grew 352%, primarily due to
increased promotional expenses, additional personnel and commissions and
bonuses on sales of the RIVA 128 and RIVA TNT graphics processors.

  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

  Interest expense remained unchanged and interest and other income increased
$1.8 million from fiscal 1999 to 2000 due to higher average cash balances as a
result of cash proceeds received from the initial public offering of our
common stock in January 1999. For fiscal 1999 compared to 1997, interest
expense was essentially unchanged, and interest and other income increased
slightly by $0.1 million.

  Income Taxes

  We recorded no income taxes in 1997. The income taxes for the one month
ended January 31, 1998 consisted entirely of current federal tax expense.
Income taxes for the year ended January 31, 1999 of $357,000 consisted of
$583,000 current federal tax expense and $226,000 deferred federal tax
benefit. We had an effective tax rate of 32% in fiscal 2000.

  Stock-Based Compensation

  We recorded deferred compensation of $4.3 million in 1997 and $361,000 in
the one month ended January 31, 1998. These deferred compensation amounts are
being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options, generally
four years. We amortized approximately $961,000 in 1997, $2.5 million in
fiscal 1999 and $662,000 in fiscal 2000. See Note 3 of Notes to the Financial
Statements.

Quarterly Results of Operations

  Selected quarterly financial data included in this table has been derived
from the internal quarterly financial reports for the periods shown. Effective
January 31, 1998, we changed our fiscal year-end financial reporting period to
a 52- or 53-week year ending on the last Sunday in January. We elected not to
restate our previous reporting periods ending December 31. Fiscal quarters for
fiscal 1999 ended April 26, 1998, July 26, 1998, October 25, 1998 and January
31, 1999. Fiscal quarters for fiscal 2000 ended on May 2, 1999, August 1,
1999, October 31, 1999 and January 30, 2000. The first fiscal quarter for
fiscal 2001 ended on April 30, 2000, and the second fiscal quarter for fiscal
2001 ended on July 30, 2000. This quarterly information is unaudited, but has
been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements,
and in the opinion of our management includes all adjustments, consisting only
of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the
information for the periods presented. The unaudited quarterly information
should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the
notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The growth in revenue and improvement
in results of operations experienced by us in recent quarters are not
necessarily indicative of future results. In addition, in light of our
significant growth in recent quarters, we believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an
indication of future performance.

Seasonality

  Our quarterly operating results vary significantly depending on factors such
as the timing of new product introductions, adequacy of component supply,
changes in component costs, variations in our product mix, seasonal promotions
by us and our customers and competitive pricing pressures. Because the timing
of these factors may vary, the results of any particular quarter may not be
indicative of results for the entire year or any future period. In addition,
the PC market generally experiences weaker sales during the summer months.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  As of July 30, 2000, we had $289.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, an
increase of $227.6 million from the end of fiscal 2000. We historically have
held our cash balances in cash equivalents such as money market funds or as
cash. We place the money market funds with high-quality financial institutions
and limit the amount of exposure with any one financial institution. We had
$157.1 million of noncancelable manufacturing commitments outstanding at July
30, 2000.

  In July 1999, we entered into an amended loan and security agreement with a
bank, which included a $10.0 million revolving loan agreement. The agreement
expired on July 29, 2000.

  Operating activities generated cash of $34.7 million during the first half
of fiscal 2001 and used cash of $895,000 during the first half of fiscal 2000.
The increase from the first half of fiscal 2000 to same period of fiscal 2001
was due to a substantial increase in net income, offset by changes in
operating assets and liabilities. Income tax benefit derived from the
difference between the exercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in
association with employees' exercise of stock options totaled $30.3 million
for the first half of fiscal 2001 compared to $503,000 in the first half of
fiscal 2000. Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated. As of July 30,
2000, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 42% of our
accounts receivable. During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded a
bad debt provision of $2.0 million related to one customer which filed for
bankruptcy. Significant bad debt write-offs in the future could harm our
business.

  To date, our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of
property and equipment. We incurred $15.1 million in capital expenditures in
the first half of fiscal 2001 for purchases of computer and emulation
equipment to support increased research and development activities and
enterprise resource planning system implementation. This amount compares to
capital expenditures of $14.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2000,
including $10.0 million attributable to a software license agreement with an
electronic design automation supplier. We expect capital expenditures to
increase as we further expand research and development initiatives and as our
employee base grows. The timing and amount of future capital expenditures will
depend primarily on our future growth. We expect to spend approximately $30.0
to $40.0 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2001, primarily for
software licenses, emulation equipment, purchase of computer and engineering
workstations, future phases of enterprise resource planning system
implementation and tenant and leasehold improvements in our new headquarters
facility.

  In April 2000, we entered into leases for our new headquarters complex in
Santa Clara, California. Our new complex will comprise four buildings,
representing approximately 500,000 total square feet. We expect the first
phase of two buildings consisting of approximately 250,000 square feet to be
completed in June 2001, the second phase of one building consisting of
approximately 125,000 square feet to be completed in July 2001 and the last
phase of one building to be completed in March 2002. The leases expire in 2012
and include two seven-year renewals at our option. Future minimum lease
payments under these operating leases total approximately $240.0 million over
the terms of the leases.

  Financing activities provided cash of $208.0 million in the first half of
fiscal 2001, compared to $2.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2000. On
March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed
to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to
Microsoft and its licensees for use in a product under development by
Microsoft. In April 2000, Microsoft paid us $200.0 million as an advance

                                      24
<PAGE>

against graphics chip purchases. Microsoft may terminate the agreement at any
time. If termination occurs prior to offset in full of the advance payments,
we would be required to return to Microsoft up to $100.0 million of the
prepayment and to convert the remainder into shares of our preferred stock at
a 30% premium to the 30-day average trading price of our common stock
preceding Microsoft's termination of the agreement.

  We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from
operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements
for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will
not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame.
Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may
be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional
capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to
obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment
purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our
business.

                                   BUSINESS

Overview

  We design, develop and market graphics processors and related software for
personal computers and digital entertainment platforms. We provide a "top-to-
bottom" family of award-winning performance 3D graphics processors and
graphics processing units, or GPUs, that set the standard for performance,
quality and features for a broad range of desktop PCs, from professional
workstations to low-cost PCs. Our 3D graphics processors are used in a wide
variety of applications, including games, business productivity, the Internet
and industrial design. Our graphics processors were the first to incorporate a
128-bit multi-texturing graphics architecture designed to deliver to users of
our products a highly immersive, interactive 3D experience with compelling
visual quality, realistic imagery and motion, stunning effects and complex
object and scene interaction at real-time frame rates. The NVIDIA TNT2, TNT2
M64 and Vanta graphics processors deliver high performance 3D and 2D graphics
at affordable prices, making them the graphics hardware of choice for a wide
range of applications for both consumer and commercial use. Our graphics
processors are designed to be architecturally compatible backward and forward
between generations, giving our OEM customers and end users a low cost of
ownership. We are recognized for developing the world's first GPU, the GeForce
256, which incorporates independent hardware transform and lighting processing
units along with a complete rendering pipeline into a single-chip
architecture. Our current GPUs, the GeForce2 Ultra, the GeForce2 GTS, the
GeForce2 MX, the NVIDIA Quadro2 Pro and the Quadro2 MXR, process hundreds of
billions of operations per second and increase the PC's ability to render
high-definition 3D scenes in real-time. Our GPU family provides superior
processing and rendering power at competitive prices and is architected to
deliver the maximum performance from industry standards such as Microsoft's
Direct3D API and SGI's OpenGL API on Windows 98, Windows 2000 and Linux
platforms. We have also developed an integrated core logic/graphics chipset
called Aladdin TNT2 through a partnership with Acer Laboratories, Inc., or
ALi, one of the leading suppliers of core logic chipsets for the PC. The
Aladdin TNT2 chipset brings NVIDIA-class graphics performance and quality to
the value PC segment.

  Our products currently are designed into products offered by virtually every
leading branded PC OEM, including Acer, Compaq, Dell, eMachines, Fujitsu-
Siemens, Gateway, HP, IBM, micronpc.com, NEC, Packard Bell NEC, SGI and Sony,
as well as leading CEMs, including Celestica, Intel, Mitac, MSI, SCI and
VisionTek, and leading add-in board manufacturers, including ASUSTek, Canopus,
Creative, ELSA and Guillemot. The benefits and performance of the NVIDIA
family of 3D graphics processors have received significant industry validation
and have enabled us and our customers to win more than 600 industry awards,
including over 20 "Editors' Choice" awards from PC Magazine during the last
three years, Edge Magazine's 1999 "Hardware Innovation of the Year,"
MicroDesign Research's "1999 Analyst's Choice for Best 3D Processor" and, in
the workstation market, Pro/E the Magazine's "Platinum Award."

Industry Background

  Interactive 3D graphics technology is emerging as one of the significant new
computing developments since the introduction of the graphical user interface.
Interactive 3D graphics is integral to various computing and entertainment
platforms such as workstations, consumer and commercial desktop PCs, Internet
appliances and home gaming consoles. 3D graphics is a powerful broadband
medium that enables the communication and visualization of information,
whether it is in professional applications like CAD/CAM and digital content
creation, commercial applications like financial analysis and business-to-
business collaboration or simply surfing the Internet or playing games. The
visually engaging and interactive nature of 3D graphics responds to consumers'
demands for a convincing simulation of reality beyond what is possible with
traditional 2D graphics. We expect that the fundamental interactive capability
and distributive nature of 3D graphics will make it the primary broadband
medium for a digitally connected world.

  We believe that a PC's interactive 3D graphics capability represents one of
the primary means by which users differentiate among various systems. PC users
today can easily differentiate the quality of graphics and prefer personal
computers that provide a superior visual experience. These factors have
dramatically increased

                                      26
<PAGE>

demand for 3D graphics processors. Mercury Research estimates that 3D graphics
will be standard in every PC unit shipped by 2001. Mercury Research also
estimates that 126.8 million desktop 3D graphics processors were sold
worldwide in 1999 and that 292.2 million will be sold worldwide in 2004.

  Continuing advancements in semiconductor process and manufacturing have made
available more powerful and affordable microprocessors and 3D graphics
processors, both of which are essential to deliver interactive 3D graphics to
the PC market. Additionally, the industry has broadly adopted Microsoft's
Direct3D API and SGI's OpenGL API, which serve as common and standard
languages between software applications and 3D graphics processors, allowing
the development of numerous 3D applications and resulting in increased
consumer demand.

  The technology required to create interactive and visually engaging 3D
graphics is algorithmically complex and computationally intensive. To deliver
high quality interactive 3D graphics, advanced 3D GPUs require millions of
transistors to process billions of arithmetic operations per second. Current
3D GPUs, like the Quadro2 and the GeForce2 Ultra, are over 100 times more
complex than 2D accelerators and comparable to the complexity of Intel Pentium
III microprocessors. Despite these ongoing advances, PC 3D graphics available
today cannot deliver in real time the quality of graphics seen in digitally-
created films like "Toy Story 2." 3D graphics like those required over 1,400
powerful workstations to render 122,699 movie frames, each of which required
from 10 minutes to three days to complete. For PCs to provide even this level
of 3D graphics capability, the performance of 3D graphics processors will need
to be improved by several more orders of magnitude, with the ultimate goal
being to achieve "real world" graphics performance well beyond that seen in
"Toy Story 2."

  We believe that a substantial market opportunity exists for providers of
performance 3D graphics processors, particularly as performance 3D graphics
have become an increasingly important requirement and point of differentiation
for PC OEMs. Consumer PC users demand a compelling visual experience and
compatibility with existing and next-generation 3D graphics applications at an
affordable price. Application developers require high-performance, standards-
based 3D architectures with broad market penetration. Since graphics is a key
point of differentiation, PC OEMs continually seek to incorporate leading-
edge, cost-effective 3D graphics solutions to build award-winning products. We
believe that providers of interactive 3D graphics solutions will compete based
on their ability to leverage their technology expertise to simultaneously meet
the needs of end users, application developers and OEMs.

Our Solution

  We designed our GPUs and graphics processors to enable PC OEMs and add-in
board manufacturers to build award-winning products by delivering state-of-
the-art interactive 3D graphics capability while maintaining affordable
prices. We believe that by developing 3D graphics solutions that provide
superior performance and address the key requirements of the PC market, we
will accelerate the adoption of 3D graphics throughout this market. We combine
scalable architectural technology with mass market economies-of-scale to
deliver a complete family of products that span workstations to low-cost value
PCs.

  The key features and benefits of our solution are as follows:

  Advanced Scalable Single-Chip Graphics Architectures. In each of the past
three years, we have introduced a graphics processor that has subsequently
defined the 3D graphics standard widely adopted by the PC industry. In 1997,
we delivered the industry's first 128-bit 3D graphics processor with the RIVA
128. The RIVA 128's wide data path enabled high frame rate playback of
interactive games. In 1998, we introduced the industry's first dual pixel
pipeline with the RIVA TNT, which provided the ability to apply multiple
textures to each polygon, enabling stunning visual effects. In 1999, we
introduced the world's first GPU, the GeForce 256, by integrating transform
and lighting into the graphics processor. Dedicated transform and lighting
engines, which are substantially more powerful than those functions on general
purpose microprocessors, provide the extremely high computational throughput
necessary to generate high-resolution polygonal 3D models. In addition, in
2000, we

                                      27
<PAGE>

introduced the first per-pixel shading GPUs, the GeForce2 GTS and GeForce2
Ultra, moving even closer to cinematic-quality real-time graphics for the
desktop PC market. Per-pixel shading allows control of the visual and material
components, such as color, shadow, light and reflectivity, used to create
realistic scenes and objects. Each of these generations has served as the
foundation for an architecturally compatible family of products designed to
offer additional products focused on either enhanced performance and features
or lower cost.

  High-Performance, Backward-Forward Compatible Software Drivers. NVIDIA
graphics processors include an extensive set of reference drivers that
translate between the software API and hardware. The NVIDIA Unified Driver
Architecture (UDA) is designed to maximize the performance of the graphics
processor and to maintain compatibility with each successive generation of our
products. These software drivers have the flexibility to be continually
enhanced in order to further improve the performance of our processors. We
believe our UDA provides a competitive advantage to our OEM customers. We are
the only graphics vendor that offers a family of graphics processors that are
binary software compatible, enabling both backward and forward compatibility
between generations as well as top-to-bottom compatibility. This compatibility
is achieved through an innovative graphics hardware architecture that
virtualizes the software interface, allowing us to innovate independent of the
API. This compatibility provides OEMs and end users with a great degree of
flexibility.

  Feature-Optimized, Standards-Based Architecture. The NVIDIA family of
graphics processors are architected to take full advantage of industry
standards such as Microsoft's Direct3D and SGI's OpenGL. We work closely with
Microsoft and SGI so that our family of graphics processors provide feature
complete, performance optimized drivers from one generation to the next. The
standards-compliant design of our graphics processors provides OEMs maximum
flexibility in the design and use of their systems. In particular, we believe
that our focus on industry standard APIs positions us well in the PC market,
as these standards proliferate and support more advanced 3D visuals. Direct3D
and OpenGL have gained broad developer support, with numerous 3D titles
currently using those APIs.

Our Strategy

  Our objective is to ultimately be the leading supplier of performance
graphics communications processors for a broad range of PCs, laptops, Internet
appliances, handhelds and any future computing device with a display. Our
current focus is on the PC market and we plan to expand into other markets.
Our strategy to achieve this objective includes the following key elements:

  Build Award-Winning, Architecturally-Compatible 3D Graphics Product Families
for the PC and Digital Entertainment Markets. Our strategy is to achieve
market share leadership in the PC and digital entertainment markets by
providing award-winning performance at every price point. By developing 3D
graphics solutions that provide superior performance and address the key
requirements of these markets, we believe that we will accelerate the adoption
of 3D graphics. As part of our strategy, we have closely aligned our product
development with Direct3D and OpenGL, which we believe maximizes third-party
software support.

  Target Leading OEMs. Our strategy is to enable our leading OEM customers to
differentiate their products in a highly competitive marketplace by using our
3D graphics processors. We believe that design wins with these industry
leaders provide market validation of our products, increase brand awareness
and enhance our ability to penetrate additional leading customer accounts. In
addition, we believe that close relationships with OEMs will allow us to
better anticipate and address customer needs with our future generations of
products. Our products currently are designed into products offered by
virtually every leading branded PC OEM, including Acer, Compaq, Dell,
eMachines, Fujitsu-Siemens, Gateway, HP, IBM, micronpc.com, NEC, Packard Bell
NEC, SGI and Sony.

  Sustain Technology and Roadmap Leadership in 3D Graphics. We are focused on
leveraging our advanced engineering capabilities to accelerate the quality and
performance of 3D graphics in PCs. A fundamental aspect of our strategy is to
actively recruit the best 3D graphics engineers in the industry, and we

                                      28
<PAGE>

believe that we have assembled an exceptionally experienced and talented
engineering team. We increased the number of our employees engaged in research
and development activities to 289 at July 30, 2000 from 214 at January 30,
2000. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently
developing multiple generations of graphics processors using independent
design teams. As we have in the past, we intend to leverage this strategy to
achieve new levels of graphics features and performance, enabling our
customers to achieve award-winning performance in their products.

  Increase Market Share. We believe that substantial market share will be
important to achieving success in the 3D graphics business. We intend to
achieve a leading share of the market by devoting substantial resources to
building award-winning families of products for a wide range of applications.

  Leverage Our Expertise in Digital Multimedia. We believe the synergy created
by the combination of 3D graphics and the Internet will fundamentally change
the way people work, learn, communicate and play. We believe that our
expertise in 3D graphics and system architecture positions us to help drive
this transformation. We are leveraging our expertise in the processing and
transmission of high-bandwidth digital media to develop products designed to
address the requirements of high-bandwidth concurrent multimedia.

NVIDIA Architecture, Products and Products Under Development

  3D Graphics Processing Architecture

  3D graphics processors create two-dimensional images, which can be displayed
on computer monitors or other output devices, from computer specifications of
three-dimensional objects or "models." These two-dimensional images are
typically the perspective view of the objects from an eye-point that changes
with time and, as such, are computationally very intensive. The 3D effect
arises from a variety of visual cues, such as perspective, occlusion, surface
shading, shadows, focus and motion. Convincing realism arises from precise
calculation of these and other effects. These calculations are best performed
by dedicated processors, which provide far more power and bandwidth than
microprocessors can deliver.

  The 3D graphics process is a series of specialized steps, often referred to
as the 3D graphics pipeline. Typically, the microprocessor chooses an eye-
point and decides which objects should be displayed. These are commonly
communicated to the graphics subsystem via a software interface, such as
Microsoft's Direct3D or SGI's OpenGL. The processing itself occurs in several
steps, as depicted and described below:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>


  Model. The model typically is expressed as a set of polygons, such as
triangles, that form the basic shape of a three-dimensional object and have
attributes such as position and color at each vertex.

  Transform and Lighting. In the transform and lighting step, the original
position and orientation of the polygons are transformed to their new position
on the screen. Based on their position and orientation, some aspects of their
surface color and lighting can be computed. The 3D visual cues of perspective
and motion are handled during this stage. These calculations require very high
floating-point computation power and are performed either by the host
microprocessor or on a higher performance GPU. Lighting occurs after transform
and provides high visual impact. Lighting effects enhance the realism of a
scene and bring rendered images one step closer to a "real world" perception.

  Polygon Setup. Polygon setup calculates the slopes of the polygon sides and
various other derivatives that greatly accelerate the rasterization process.
Although early graphics devices performed these calculations in the host
microprocessor, existing 3D graphics processors perform these calculations,
permitting significantly higher performance. By offloading setup and
rasterization from the microprocessor, the additional bandwidth can be
utilized for computationally-intensive operations such as character animation,
physics and object behaviors.

                                      29
<PAGE>

  Rasterization. Rasterization computes the color and other information for
every pixel (dot on the screen) that a transformed polygon touches. A number
of complex algorithms compute the color uniquely for each pixel, as well as
perform the remaining visual cues, such as shading, shadows, focus and
occlusion. This is the most computationally intensive step of the graphics
pipeline and the processors are required to perform up to 1,000 calculations
per pixel, with this number increasing rapidly as the technology advances.

  Display. Display consists of sequentially reading out the color of each
pixel at a rate matched to the monitor. Unlike the other stages in the 3D
graphics pipeline, which are purely digital, the signals to the monitor are
analog, and the frequencies are far higher.

  The complexity of the different steps in the 3D graphics pipeline requires
billions of floating-point and integer operations in real time in order to
deliver a realistic and interactive experience. Image quality determines
whether 3D computer representation looks realistic, and 3D performance
determines whether a 3D system conveys a sense of fluid motion in real time.
If the performance is below a certain threshold, a 3D system can reduce the
productivity or the enjoyment of the user, even if the image quality is high.
The challenge with high-quality 3D is to deliver the processing power required
to perform these computations without creating bottlenecks in the 3D graphics
pipeline.

Other Products and Projects

  Aladdin TNT2 Integrated Chipset

  The Aladdin TNT2 is a joint development with ALi. It combines our award-
winning TNT2 core with ALi's M1631 North Bridge. This chipset is sold with an
ALi M1535D South Bridge and brings NVIDIA graphics performance and image
quality to the fast growing value PC segment while reducing overall system
cost. ALi is responsible for the sale of this product. The Aladdin TNT2 began
commercial shipment in March 2000.

  Microsoft Xbox

  On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we
agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to
Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox video game console under
development by Microsoft. In April 2000, Microsoft paid us $200.0 million as
an advance against graphics chip purchases. Microsoft may terminate the
agreement at any time. If termination occurs prior to offset in full of the
advance payments, we would be required to return to Microsoft up to $100.0
million of the prepayment and to convert the remainder into our preferred
stock at a 30% premium to the 30-day average trading price of our common stock
preceding Microsoft's termination of the agreement. In addition, in the event
that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to
or greater than thirty percent (30%) of the outstanding shares of our common
stock, Microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock.
The graphics chip contemplated by the agreement is highly complex, and the
development and release of the Microsoft Xbox video game console and its
commercial success are dependent upon a number of factors, many of which we
cannot control. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing
the graphics chip for use by Microsoft or that the product will be developed
or released, or if released, will be commercially successful.

Sales and Marketing

  Our worldwide sales strategy is a key part of our objective to become the
leading supplier of performance 3D graphics processors for PCs. Our sales team
works closely with PC OEMs, add-in board manufacturers and

                                      33
<PAGE>

industry trendsetters to define product features, performance, price and
timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a high level of
technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support a
competitive and complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled
team of application engineers to assist PC OEMs and add-in board manufacturers
in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our
products. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key
to improving PC OEMs' and add-in board manufacturers' time-to-market,
maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction among PC OEMs and add-in
board manufacturers and fostering relationships that encourage customers to
use the next generation of our products.

  In the 3D graphics market, the sales process involves influencing leading PC
OEMs' and add-in board manufacturers' graphics processor purchasing decisions,
achieving key design wins and supporting the product design into high volume
production. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system
integrator channel that is serviced by add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading
CEMs, add-in board manufacturers and distributors that have relationships with
a broad range of major PC OEMs and/or strong brand name recognition in the
retail channel. Currently, we sell a significant majority of our graphics
processors directly to CEMs and add-in board manufacturers, which then sell
boards with our graphics processor to leading OEMs, to retail outlets and to a
large number of system integrators.

  To encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games
optimized for platforms utilizing our products, we seek to establish and
maintain strong relationships in the software development community.
Engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software
developers to promote and discuss our products, as well as to ascertain
product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes
products available to partners prior to volume availability to encourage the
development of software titles that are optimized for our products.

Backlog

  Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders that are
cancelable without significant penalties. The quantity of our products
actually purchased by the customer as well as shipment schedules are subject
to revisions to reflect changes in the customer's requirements and
manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by
short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry
practice and experience, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular
date is indicative of future results.

Manufacturing

  We have a "fabless" manufacturing strategy whereby we employ world-class
suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including fabrication,
assembly and testing. This strategy leverages the expertise of industry-
leading, ISO-certified suppliers in such areas as fabrication, assembly,
quality control and assurance, reliability and testing. In addition, we are
able to avoid most of the significant costs and risks associated with owning
and operating manufacturing operations. These suppliers are also responsible
for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our
products. As a result, we can focus resources on product design, additional
quality assurance, marketing and customer support.

  Our graphics processors are fabricated by TSMC and WaferTech and assembled
and tested by Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, ChipPAC and Siliconware. We
receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming
quality assurance and then ship them to CEMs, motherboard and add-in board
manufacturer customers from our Santa Clara location in the U.S. and a third-
party warehouse in Singapore. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test
the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, then ship the
products to the retail, system integrator or OEM markets as add-in board
solutions. Our hardware and software development teams work closely with
certification agencies, Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs and our OEM
customers to ensure that both our boards and software drivers are certified
for inclusion in the OEMs' products.

Research and Development

  We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products
designed to deliver leading 3D graphics performance and features is essential
to our future success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on
concurrently developing multiple generations of graphics processors using
independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are performed
within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware
engineering, VLSI design engineering, process engineering, and architecture
and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient
simultaneous development of multiple generations of products.

  A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships
with leaders in the CAD industry. We have invested significant resources to
develop relationships with industry leaders, including Avant! Corporation,
Cadence Design Systems, Inc., IKOS Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc., often
assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We
believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation
development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us
remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop products on a
rapid basis that utilize leading-edge technology. We believe this approach
assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC manufacturers.

  We have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and
have 289 full-time employees engaged in research and development as of July
30, 2000, compared to 214 employees as of January 30, 2000. Research and
development expenses totaled $7.1 million in 1997, $25.1 million in the year
ended January 31, 1999, $47.4 million in the year ended January 30, 2000 and
$38.0 million in the six months ended July 30, 2000.

Competition

  The market for 3D graphics processors for PCs is intensely competitive and
characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and
declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive
factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access
to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support,
conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of
graphics processors and total system costs of add-in boards or motherboards.
We expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new
market entrants with products that may be less costly than our 3D graphics
processors or may provide better performance or additional features not
provided by our products.

  Our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend
to provide 3D graphics solutions for the PC market. Our competitors include
the following:

  .  suppliers of graphics add-in boards that utilize their internally
     developed graphics chips, such as ATI and Matrox;

  .  suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate 2D and 3D
     graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as
     Intel, Silicon Integrated Systems and Via Technologies;

  .  companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market and
     provide high end 3D solutions for PCs and workstations, including
     3Dlabs, SGI and Evans and Sutherland Computer; and

  .  companies that focus on the video game market, such as 3Dfx and
     VideoLogic.

  If and to the extent we offer products outside of the 3D graphics processor
market, we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well
as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately
predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter.


                                      35

Patents and Proprietary Rights

  We rely primarily on a combination of patent, trademarks, copyrights, trade
secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing
arrangements to protect our intellectual property. We own 33 issued patents
and have 46 U.S. patent applications pending. Our issued patents have
expiration dates from April 2015 to April 2018. Our issued patents and pending
patent applications relate to technology developed by us in connection with
the development of our 3D graphics processors. We have no foreign patents or
patent applications. We seek patents that have broad application in the
semiconductor industry and that we believe will provide a competitive
advantage. However, our pending patent applications or any future applications
may not be approved, and any issued patents may not provide us with
competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. We have licensed
technology from third parties for incorporation in our graphics processors and
expect to continue to enter into agreements like this for future products.
These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross-
license of technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these
arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business
could suffer. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary
information through confidentiality agreements with manufacturers and other
partners, proprietary information agreements with employees and consultants
and other security measures. We also rely on trademarks and trade secret laws
to protect our intellectual property.

Employees

  As of July 30, 2000 we had 529 employees, 289 of whom were engaged in
research and development and 240 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing,
operations and administrative positions. None of our employees is covered by
collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our
employees is good.

Facilities

  We lease approximately 117,000 square feet for our headquarters in Santa
Clara, California, under leases expiring in 2002. We also lease a design
center consisting of approximately 2,900 square feet in one building in
Durham, North Carolina, pursuant to a lease that expires in March 2002. In
addition, we lease sales and administrative offices in Texas, Washington,
Arizona, Singapore and the United Kingdom to support our customers. In April
2000, we entered into leases for our new headquarters complex in Santa Clara,
California. Our new complex will comprise four buildings, representing
approximately 500,000 total square feet. We expect the first phase of two
buildings consisting of approximately 250,000 square feet to be completed in
June 2001, the second phase of one building consisting of approximately
125,000 square feet to be completed in July 2001 and the last phase of one
building to be completed in March 2002. The leases expire in 2012 and include
two seven-year renewals at our option. We believe that we currently have
sufficient facilities to conduct our operations for the next twelve months,
although we expect to lease additional facilities throughout the world as our
business requires.

Legal Proceedings

  On September 21, 1998, 3Dfx filed a patent infringement lawsuit against us
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
alleging infringement of a 3Dfx patent. On March 2, 1999, 3Dfx added a second
patent to the suit and on May 24, 1999, 3Dfx added a third patent to the suit.
The amended complaint alleges that our RIVA TNT, RIVA TNT2 and RIVA TNT2 Ultra
products infringe the patents in suit and seeks unspecified compensatory and
trebled damages and attorneys' fees. Our current generation of products is not
identified as infringing any of the patents in suit. We have filed an answer
and counter-claims asserting that the patents in suit are invalid and not
infringed. These assertions are supported by our investigations to date and an
opinion from our patent counsel in this suit. The District Court has recently
ruled on claims construction issues, but a trial date has not yet been set.

  On August 28, 2000, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against 3Dfx in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The
lawsuit alleges that 3Dfx's graphics chip and card products, which are used to
accelerate 3D graphics on personal computers, infringe five of our patents and
seeks an injunction

                                      36
<PAGE>

restraining 3Dfx from manufacturing, selling or importing infringing graphics
chip and card products including its Voodoo3, Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 and VSA-100
family of products, as well as monetary damages. The matter is in its earliest
stages, discovery has not yet begun and no trial date has been set.

  On February 22, 2000, Graphiques Matrox, Inc. and Systemes Electroniques
Matrox Ltd. (collectively "Matrox") filed suit against us in the Superior
Court, Judicial District of Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada. The suit
alleges that we improperly solicited and recruited Matrox employees and
encouraged Matrox employees to breach their Matrox confidentiality and/or non-
competition agreements. The suit by Matrox seeks, among other things, certain
injunctive relief. We believe that the claims asserted by Matrox are without
merit and we intend to vigorously defend this suit.

  On May 19, 2000, we filed suit against Matrox in Santa Clara County Superior
Court alleging that Matrox's efforts to prevent its current and former
employees from pursuing employment opportunities with us constitute
interference with prospective economic advantage and contract and unfair
competition. Our suit seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary damages,
a declaration that Matrox's confidentiality and/or non-competition agreements
are unenforceable under California law and a declaration that its use of those
agreements and other tactics constitutes unfair competition. On May 26, 2000,
the case was transferred to the San Jose Division of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California. On June 14, 2000,
Matrox filed an answer denying our claims and a counterclaim alleging trade
secret misappropriation, intentional interference with contractual relations
and unfair competition. Matrox's California suit seeks unspecified monetary
damages and injunctive relief. We filed an answer to this counterclaim on July
7, 2000, denying all of Matrox's claims. As with the Montreal action, we
believe that the claims asserted by Matrox are without merit and we intend to
vigorously defend this suit.

  In addition, we may be subject to litigation in the future. See "Risk
Factors--We are subject to a patent infringement lawsuit and could be subject
to future lawsuits that could divert our resources and result in the payment
of substantial damages." From time to time, we are also subject to claims in
the ordinary course of business, none of which in our view would have a
material adverse impact on our business or financial position if resolved
unfavorably.

 (1) This table is based upon information supplied by officers, directors and
     principal stockholders and Schedules 13D and 13G filed with the
     Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless otherwise indicated in the
     footnotes to this table and subject to community property laws where
     applicable, we believe that each of the stockholders named in this table
     has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated
     as beneficially owned. Applicable percentages are based on 65,453,929
     shares of common stock outstanding on September 1, 2000. In computing the
     number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage
     ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to options held
     by that person that are exercisable within 60 days are deemed
     outstanding. These shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the
     purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

                         DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

  Our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock,
$.001 par value and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value. As
of September 1, 2000, there were 65,453,929 shares of common stock outstanding
and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. On May 20, 2000, the Board of
Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our common stock, to be
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The stock split entitled each
stockholder of record at the close of business on June 12, 2000, to receive
one additional share for every outstanding share of common stock held. Our
transfer agent delivered the additional shares resulting from the stock split
on or about June 26, 2000.

Common Stock

  The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of
record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Subject to
preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of the preferred
stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such
dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally
available therefor. See "Dividend Policy." In the event of our liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up, holders of the common stock are entitled to share
ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the
liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders
of common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common
stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of common
stock are, and all shares of common stock to be outstanding upon the
completion of this offering will be, fully paid and non-assessable.

Preferred Stock

  Pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or
Certificate, the Board of Directors has the authority, without further action
by the stockholders, to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one
or more series and to fix the designations, powers, preferences, privileges,
and relative participating, optional, or special rights and the
qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, including dividend
rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation
preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of the common
stock. The Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, can issue
preferred stock with voting, conversion, or other rights that could adversely
affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock.
Preferred stock could thus be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or
prevent our having a change in control or make removal of management more
difficult. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect
of decreasing the market price of the common stock, and may adversely affect
the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. We have no current
plans to issue any of the authorized preferred stock.

Registration Rights

  In addition to the registration rights to be granted to the holders of the
notes, certain Holders (or their permitted transferees) of shares of our
common stock are entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration
of such shares under the Securities Act. If we propose to register our common
stock, subject to certain exceptions, under the Securities Act, the Holders
are entitled to notice of the registration and are entitled at our expense to
include such shares therein, provided that the managing underwriters have the
right to limit the number of such shares included in the registration. These
registration rights do not apply with respect to any offering of our common
stock under this prospectus. In addition, certain of the Holders may require
us, at our expense, on no more than one occasion, to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act with respect to their shares of common
stock. Further, certain Holders may require us, once every 12 months and, on
no more than two occasions, at our expense to register the shares on Form S-3,
subject to certain conditions and limitations. These rights expire in January
2004.

Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Charter Documents and Delaware Law

  Charter Documents

  Our Certificate and Bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the
effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in
control or management. First, the Certificate provides that all stockholder
action must be effected at a duly called meeting of holders and not by a
consent in writing. Second, the Bylaws provide that special meetings of the
holders may be called only by (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii)
the Chief Executive Officer or (iii) the Board of Directors pursuant to a
resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Third, the Certificate and the
Bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors. The Certificate includes a
provision requiring cumulative voting for directors only if required by
applicable California law. Under cumulative voting, a minority stockholder
holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the
election of one or more directors. As a result of the provisions of the
Certificate and applicable California and Delaware law, at any annual meeting
whereby we had at least 800 stockholders as of the end of the fiscal year
prior to the record date for the annual meeting, stockholders will not be able
to cumulate votes for directors. Finally, the Bylaws establish procedures,
including advance notice procedures with regard to the nomination of
candidates for election as directors and stockholder proposals. These
provisions of the Certificate and Bylaws could discourage potential
acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent our having a change in
control or management. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing
changes in our management.

  Delaware Takeover Statute

  We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware
corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with a person
characterized as an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after
the date of the transaction pursuant to which such person became an interested
stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a manner
prescribed by Delaware law. For purposes of Section 203, a business
combination includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a
financial benefit to the interested stockholder, and an "interested
stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns
(or within three years prior, did own) 15% or more of the company's voting
stock.

Transfer Agent and Registrar

  The transfer agent and registrar for the common stock is ChaseMellon
Shareholder Services, L.L.C. Its address is 235 Montgomery Street, 23rd Floor,
San Francisco, California 94104 and its telephone number is (415) 743-1444.

                        DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES

  We may issue either senior or subordinated debt securities. Senior debt or
senior convertible debt securities and subordinated debt or subordinated
convertible debt securities will be issued in one or more series under either
a senior indenture or a subordinated indenture between us and Chase Manhattan
Bank and Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association, as Trustee. In
the following discussion, we sometimes refer to the two indentures as the
"indentures."

  This prospectus briefly outlines the provisions of the indentures. The
indentures are filed as exhibits to the registration statement and you should
read the indentures for provisions that may be important to you. The
indentures are substantially identical except for the subordination and
negative pledge provisions described below.

Issuances in Series

  The indentures do not limit the amount of debt we may issue. We may issue
the debt securities in one or more series with the same or various maturities,
at a price of 100% of their principal amount or at a premium or a discount.
The debt securities will not be secured by any of our property or assets.

  The prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities being
offered will contain the specific terms relating to the offering. These terms
will include some or all of the following:

  .  whether the debt securities are senior or subordinated;

  .  the total principal amount of the debt securities;

  .  the percentage of the principal amount at which the debt securities will
     be issued and whether the debt securities will be "original issue
     discount" securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we issue
     original issue discount debt securities (securities that are issued at a
     substantial discount below their principal amount because they pay no
     interest or pay interest that is below market rates at the time of
     issuance), we will describe the special United States federal income tax
     and other considerations of a purchase of original issue discount debt
     securities in the prospectus supplement;

  .  the date or dates on which principal will be payable and whether the
     debt securities will be payable on demand by the holders on any date;

  .  the manner in which we will calculate payments of principal, premium or
     interest and whether any payment will be fixed or based on an index or
     formula or the value of another security, commodity or other asset;

  .  the interest payment dates;

  .  optional or mandatory redemption terms;

  .  authorized denominations, if other than $1,000 and integral multiples of
     $1,000;

  .  the terms on which holders of the debt securities may convert or
     exchange these securities into or for our stock or other securities or
     another entity and any specific terms relating to the conversion or
     exchange feature;

  .  the currency in which the debt securities will be denominated or
     principal, premium or interest will be payable, if other than U.S.
     dollars;

  .  whether the debt securities are to be issued as individual certificates
     to each holder or in the form of global securities held by a depositary
     on behalf of holders;

  .  information describing any book-entry features;

  .  whether and under what circumstances we will pay additional amounts on
     any debt securities held by a person who is not a United States person
     for tax purposes and whether we can redeem the debt securities if we
     have to pay additional amounts;

                                      45
<PAGE>

  .  the names and duties of any co-trustees, depositories, authenticating
     agents, paying agents, transfer agents or registrars for any series; and

  .  any other terms consistent with the above.

Payment and Transfer

  We may issue debt securities as registered securities, which means that the
name of the holder will be entered in a register which will be kept by the
Trustee or another of our agents, or unregistered securities.

  Unless we state otherwise in a prospectus supplement, we will make principal
and interest payments at the office of the paying agent or agents we name in
the prospectus supplement or by mailing a check to you at the address we have
for you in the register.

  Unless we describe other procedures in a prospectus supplement, you will be
able to transfer registered debt securities at the office of the transfer
agent or agents we name in the prospectus supplement. You may also exchange
registered debt securities at the office of the transfer agent for an equal
aggregate principal amount of registered debt securities of the same series
having the same maturity date, interest rate and other terms as long as the
debt securities are issued in authorized denominations.

  Neither we nor the Trustee will impose any service charge for any transfer
or exchange of a debt security; however, we may ask you to pay any taxes or
other governmental charges in connection with a transfer or exchange of debt
securities.

Book Entry System

  We may issue debt securities under a book-entry system in the form of one or
more global securities. We will register the global securities in the name of
a depositary or its nominee and deposit the global securities with that
depositary. Unless we state otherwise in the prospectus supplement, The
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York will be the depositary if we use
a depositary.

  DTC has advised us as follows:

  .  DTC is:

    .  a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the
       State of New York;

    .  a "banking organization" within the meaning of the New York banking
       law;

    .  a member of the Federal Reserve System;

    .  a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform
       Commercial Code; and

    .  a "clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section
       17A of the Exchange Act.

  .  DTC was created to hold securities of its participants and to facilitate
     the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its
     participants through electronic book entry changes in accounts of its
     participants, eliminating the need for physical movements of securities
     certificates.

  .  DTC's participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
     companies, clearing corporations and others, some of whom own DTC.

  .  Access to DTC's book-entry system is also available to others that clear
     through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either
     directly or indirectly.

  Following the issuance of a global security in registered form, the
depositary will credit the accounts of its participants with the debt
securities upon our instructions. Only persons who hold directly or indirectly
through financial institutions that are participants in the depositary can
hold beneficial interests in the global securities. Since the laws of some
jurisdictions require certain types of purchasers to take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive form, you may encounter difficulties in your
ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global security.

                                      46
<PAGE>

  So long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a global
security, we and the Trustee will treat the depositary as the sole owner or
holder of the debt securities for purposes of the applicable indenture.
Therefore, except as set forth below, you will not be entitled to have debt
securities registered in your name or to receive physical delivery of
certificates representing the debt securities. Accordingly, you will have to
rely on the procedures of the depositary and the participant in the depositary
through whom you hold your beneficial interest in order to exercise any rights
of a holder under the indentures. We understand that under existing practices,
the depositary would act upon the instructions of a participant or authorize
that participant to take any action that a holder is entitled to take.

  We will make all payments of principal, premium and interest on the debt
securities to the depositary. We expect that the depositary will then credit
participants' accounts proportionately with these payments on the payment date
and that the participants will in turn credit their customers in accordance
with their customary practices. Neither we nor the Trustee will be responsible
for making any payments to participants or customers of participants or for
maintaining any records relating to the holdings of participants and their
customers and you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and
its participants.

  Global securities are generally not transferable. We will issue physical
certificates to beneficial owners of a global security if:

  .  the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
     depositary and we do not appoint a successor within 90 days;

  .  the depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the
     Exchange Act and we do not appoint a successor within 90 days; or

  .  we decide in our sole discretion that we do not want to have the debt
     securities of that series represented by global securities.

Subordination

  Payment on the subordinated debt securities will, to the extent provided in
the subordinated indenture, be subordinated in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of all of our senior indebtedness. The subordinated debt
securities also are effectively subordinated to all debt and other
liabilities, including trade payables and lease obligations, if any, of our
subsidiaries.

  Upon any distribution of our assets upon any dissolution, winding up,
liquidation or reorganization, the payment of the principal of, or premium, if
any, interest, and liquidated damages, if any, on the subordinated debt
securities will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in
full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of senior
indebtedness of all senior indebtedness. In the event of any acceleration of
the subordinated debt securities because of an event of default, the holders
of any outstanding senior indebtedness would be entitled to payment in full in
cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of senior indebtedness of
all senior indebtedness obligations before the holders of the subordinated
debt securities are entitled to receive any payment or distribution. We are
required under the subordinated indenture to promptly notify holders of senior
indebtedness if payment of the subordinated debt securities is accelerated
because of an event of default.

  We may not make any payment on the subordinated debt securities if:

  .  a default in the payment of designated senior indebtedness occurs and is
     continuing beyond any applicable period of grace (called a "payment
     default"); or

  .  a default other than a payment default on any designated senior
     indebtedness occurs and is continuing that permits holders of designated
     senior indebtedness to accelerate its maturity, or in the case of a
     lease, a default occurs and is continuing that permits the lessor to
     either terminate the lease or require us to make an irrevocable offer to
     terminate the lease following an event of default under the lease,

                                      47
<PAGE>

     and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (called a "payment
     blockage notice") from us or any other person permitted to give such
     notice under the subordinated indenture (called a "non-payment
     default").

  We may resume payments and distributions on the subordinated debt securities:

  .  in case of a payment default, upon the date on which such default is
     cured or waived or ceases to exist; and

  .  in case of a non-payment default, the earlier of the date on which such
     nonpayment default is cured or waived or ceases to exist or 179 days
     after the date on which the payment blockage notice is received, if the
     maturity of the designated senior indebtedness has not been accelerated,
     or in the case of any lease, 179 days after notice is received if we
     have not received notice that the lessor under such lease has exercised
     its right to terminate the lease or require us to make an irrevocable
     offer to terminate the lease following an event of default under the
     lease.

  No non-payment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery
of any payment blockage notice shall be the basis for any later payment
blockage notice.

  If the Trustee or any holder of the subordinated debt securities receives any
payment or distribution of our assets in contravention of the subordination
provisions on the subordinated debt securities before all senior indebtedness
is paid in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to holders of senior
indebtedness then such payment or distribution will be held in trust for the
benefit of holders of senior indebtedness or their representatives to the
extent necessary to make payment in full in cash or payment satisfactory to the
holders of senior indebtedness of all unpaid senior indebtedness.

  In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or reorganization, holders of
senior indebtedness may receive more, ratably, and holders of the subordinated
debt securities may receive less, ratably, than our other creditors. This
subordination will not prevent the occurrence of any event of default under the
subordinated indenture.

  As of July 30, 2000, no senior indebtedness was outstanding. We are not
prohibited from incurring debt, including senior indebtedness, under the
indentures. We may from time to time incur additional debt, including senior
indebtedness.

  We are obligated to pay reasonable compensation to the Trustee and to
indemnify the Trustee against certain losses, liabilities or expenses incurred
by the Trustee in connection with its duties relating to the debt securities.
The Trustee's claims for these payments will generally be senior to those of
holders of debt securities in respect of all funds collected or held by the
Trustee.

Conversion Rights

  The prospectus supplement will describe, if applicable, the terms on which
the holders may convert debt securities into common stock. The conversion may
be mandatory or may be at the option of the holder of debt securities. The
prospectus supplement will describe how the number of shares of common stock to
be received upon conversion would be calculated.

Certain Definitions

  "designated senior indebtedness" shall mean our obligations under any senior
indebtedness that expressly provides that such senior indebtedness shall be
"designated senior indebtedness" for purposes of the subordinated indenture.

  The instrument or agreement for designated senior indebtedness may place
limitations and conditions on the right of senior indebtedness to exercise the
rights of designated senior indebtedness.

                                       48
<PAGE>

  "indebtedness" means:

  (1)  all indebtedness, obligations and other liabilities for borrowed
       money, including overdrafts, foreign exchange contracts, currency
       exchange agreements, interest rate protection agreements, and any
       loans or advances from banks, or evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes
       or similar instruments, other than any account payable or other
       accrued current liability or obligation incurred in the ordinary
       course of business in connection with the obtaining of materials or
       services;

  (2)  all reimbursement obligations and other liabilities with respect to
       letters of credit, bank guarantees or bankers' acceptances;

  (3)  all obligations and liabilities in respect of leases required in
       conformity with generally accepted accounting principles to be
       accounted for as capitalized lease obligations on our balance sheet;

  (4)  all obligations and other liabilities under any lease or related
       document in connection with the lease of real property which provides
       that we are contractually obligated to purchase or cause a third party
       to purchase the leased property and thereby guarantee a minimum
       residual value of the leased property to the lessor and our
       obligations under the lease or related document to purchase or to
       cause a third party to purchase the leased property;

  (5)  all obligations with respect to an interest rate or other swap, cap or
       collar agreement or other similar instrument or agreement or foreign
       currency hedge, exchange, purchase agreement or other similar
       instrument or agreement;

  (6)  all direct or indirect guaranties or similar agreements, our
       obligations or liabilities to purchase, acquire or otherwise assure a
       creditor against loss in respect of, indebtedness, obligations or
       liabilities of others of the type described in (1) through (5) above;

  (7)  any indebtedness or other obligations described in (1) through (6)
       above secured by any mortgage, pledge, lien or other encumbrance
       existing on property which is owned or held by us; and

  (8)  any and all refinancings, replacements, deferrals, renewals,
       extensions and refundings of, or amendments, modifications or
       supplements to, any indebtedness, obligation or liability of the kind
       described in clauses (1) through (7) above.

  "senior indebtedness" means the principal, premium, if any, interest,
including any interest accruing after bankruptcy and rent or termination
payment on or other amounts due on our current or future indebtedness, whether
created, incurred, assumed, guaranteed or in effect guaranteed by us,
including any refinancings, replacements, deferrals, renewals, extensions,
refundings, amendments, modifications or supplements to the above. However,
senior indebtedness does not include:

  .  indebtedness that expressly provides that it shall not be senior in
     right of payment to the subordinated debt securities or expressly
     provides that it is on the same basis or junior to the subordinated debt
     securities;

  .  our indebtedness to any of our majority-owned subsidiaries; and

  .  the subordinated debt securities.

Negative Pledge

  We have agreed in the senior indenture for the benefit of the holders of the
senior debt securities that, with some exceptions, neither we nor our
subsidiaries will create a lien to secure debt that is the same seniority with
or subordinated to the senior debt securities, unless we secure the senior
debt securities equally with the secured debt.

                                      49
<PAGE>

Consolidation, Merger, Sale or Conveyance

  The indentures do not prevent us from any consolidation or merger with any
other person or the sale of all of the property of our property to any other
person. In the event we undertake a consolidation, merger or sale of all of
our property, however, the person with which we consolidate, merge or sell all
of our property must agree:

  .  to pay the principal, premium and interest on the debt securities; and

  .  to the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and
     conditions of the indentures to be performed by us.

  If the debt securities are convertible for our other securities or other
entities, the person with whom we consolidate, merge or sell all of our
property must make provisions for the conversion of the debt securities into
securities which the holders of the debt securities would have received if
they had converted the debt securities before the consolidation, merger or
sale.

  We must deliver to the trustee an officer's certificate and an opinion of
counsel that the consolidation, merger or sale complies with the indentures.

Modification of the Indentures

  In general, our rights and obligations and the rights of the holders under
the indentures may be modified if the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected by
the modification consent to it. However, under the terms of the indentures,
each indenture provides that, unless each affected holder agrees, we cannot
make any adverse change to any payment term of a debt security such as:

  .  extending the maturity date;

  .  extending the date on which we have to pay interest or make a sinking
     fund payment;

  .  reducing the interest rate;

  .  reducing the amount of principal we have to repay;

  .  changing the currency in which we have to make any payment of principal,
     premium or interest;

  .  modifying any redemption or repurchase right to the detriment of the
     holder;

  .  modifying any right to convert or exchange the debt securities for
     another security to the detriment of the holder;

  .  impairing any right of a holder to bring suit for payment;

  .  reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of debt
     securities needed to make any amendment to either indenture or to waive
     any covenant or default;

  .  waive any payment default; or

  .  make any change to such sections of either indenture.

  However, if we and the Trustee agree, we can amend the indentures without
notifying any holders or seeking their consent if the amendment does not
materially and adversely affect any holder.

Events of Default

  When we use the term "event of default" in the indentures, here are some
examples of what we mean.

  Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, an event of default
with respect to a series of debt securities occurs if:

  .  we fail to pay the principal or any premium on any debt security of that
     series when due;

                                      50
<PAGE>

  .  we fail to pay interest when due on any debt security of that series for
     30 days;

  .  we fail to perform any other covenant in either indenture and this
     failure continues for 60 days after we receive written notice of it from
     the Trustee or from the holders of 25% in principal amount of the
     outstanding debt securities of such series;

  .  a creditor commences involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
     proceedings against us and we are unable to obtain a stay or a dismissal
     of that proceeding within 90 days; or

  .  we voluntarily seek relief under bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
     or a court enters an order for relief against us under these laws.

  The supplemental indenture or the form of security for a particular series
of debt securities may include additional events of default or changes to the
events of default described above. For any additional or different events of
default applicable to a particular series of debt securities, see the
prospectus supplement relating to such series.

  The Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any
default (except in the payment of principal or interest) if it considers such
withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders. By default
we mean any event which is an event of default described above or would be an
event of default but for the giving of notice or the passage of time.

  If an event of default occurs and continues, the Trustee or the holders of
the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities specified below may
require us to repay immediately (or "accelerate"):

  .  the entire principal of the debt securities of such series; or

  .  if the debt securities are original issue discount securities, such
     portion of the principal as may be described in the applicable
     prospectus supplement.

  If the event of default occurs because we defaulted in a payment of
principal or interest on the debt securities, then the Trustee or the holders
of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of debt securities of that
series can accelerate that series of debt securities. If the event of default
occurs because we failed to perform any other covenant in the indentures or
any covenant that we agreed to for the benefit of one or more series of debt
securities, then the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate
principal amount of debt securities of all series affected, voting as one
class, can accelerate all of the affected series of debt securities. If the
event of default occurs because we become involved in bankruptcy proceedings
then all of the debt securities under the indentures will be accelerated
automatically. If the event of default occurs because we defaulted on some of
our other indebtedness or because that indebtedness becomes accelerated as
described above, then the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the
aggregate principal amount of the debt securities outstanding under the
indentures, voting as one class, can accelerate all of the debt securities
outstanding under the indentures. Therefore, except in the case of a default
by us on a payment of principal or interest on the debt securities of your
series or a default due to our bankruptcy or insolvency, it is possible that
you may not be able to accelerate the debt securities of your series because
of the failure of holders of other series to take action.

  The holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the debt
securities of all affected series, voting as one class, can rescind this
accelerated payment requirement or waive any past default or event of default
or allow us to not comply with any provision of the indentures. However, they
cannot waive a default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on, any of the debt securities.

  Other than its duties in case of a default, the Trustee is not obligated to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the indentures at the request,
order or direction of any holders, unless the holders offer the Trustee
reasonable indemnity. If they provide this reasonable indemnity, the holders
of a majority in principal amount of all affected series of debt securities,
voting as one class, may direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding or any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any power
conferred upon the Trustee, for any series of debt securities.

                                      51
<PAGE>

  We are not required to provide the Trustee with any certificate or other
document saying that we are in compliance with the indentures or that there
are no defaults.

Defeasance

  When we use the term defeasance, we mean discharge from some or all of our
obligations under the indentures. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus
supplement, if we deposit with the Trustee sufficient cash or U.S. government
securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other sums due
to the stated maturity date or a redemption date of the debt securities of a
particular series, then at our option:

  .  we will be discharged from our obligations with respect to the debt
     securities of such series, except as to any surviving rights of
     registration or transfer or exchange or conversion of debt securities of
     that series expressly provided for; or

  .  we will no longer be under any obligation to comply with the negative
     pledge contained in the senior indenture, and the Events of Default
     relating to failures to comply with covenants will no longer apply to
     us.

  If we are discharged from our obligations with respect to the debt
securities of a particular series, the holders of the debt securities of the
affected series will not be entitled to the benefits of the indentures except
for registration of transfer and exchange of debt securities and replacement
of lost, stolen or mutilated debt securities. Instead the holders will only be
able to rely on the deposited funds or obligations for payment.

  We must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the
deposit and related defeasance would not cause the holders of the debt
securities to recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes.
We must also deliver a ruling to such effect received from or published by the
United States Internal Revenue Service if we are discharged from our
obligations with respect to the debt securities.

Concerning the Trustee

  We have appointed Chase Manhattan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., a national
banking association, the Trustee under the indentures. The Trustee or its
affiliates may provide banking and other services to us in the ordinary course
of their business.

Governing Law

  The laws of the State of New York will govern the indentures and the debt
securities.

                             PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

  We may sell the securities being offered by this prospectus through agents,
underwriters or dealers.

  Agents designated by us from time to time may solicit offers to purchase the
securities offered by this prospectus. Any agent involved in the offer or sale
of those securities may be deemed to be an underwriter under the Securities
Act and we will name that agent and describe any commissions payable by us to
that agent in a prospectus supplement. Any agent appointed by us will be
acting on a reasonable efforts basis for the period of its appointment or, if
indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, on a firm commitment basis.
We may be obligated under agreements with these agents to indemnify them
against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
These agents may also engage in transactions with or perform services for us
in the ordinary course of business.

  If we utilize any underwriters in any sale of the securities in respect of
which this prospectus is delivered, we will enter into an underwriting
agreement with those underwriters at the time of sale to them and the names of
the underwriters and the terms of the transaction will be set forth in the
prospectus supplement. That prospectus supplement will be used by the
underwriters to make resales of the securities in respect of which this
prospectus is delivered to the public. We may be obligated under the
underwriting agreements with these underwriters to indemnify them against
civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. These
underwriters may also engage in transactions with or perform services for us
in the ordinary course of business.

  If we utilize a dealer in any sale of the securities in respect of which the
prospectus is delivered, we will sell the securities to the dealer, as
principal. The dealer may then resell those securities to the public at
varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale. We may be
obligated under agreements with these dealers to indemnify them against civil
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. These dealers may
also engage in transactions with or perform services for us in the ordinary
course of business.

  If so indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will authorize
agents, underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from purchasers to purchase
the securities from us at the public offering price set forth in the
prospectus supplement under delayed delivery contracts providing for payment
and delivery of those securities on a specified date in the future. These
delayed delivery contracts will be subject to only those conditions set forth
in the prospectus supplement, and we will set forth the commission payable for
solicitation of these offers in the prospectus supplement.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
NVIDIA Corporation:

  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation (the
Company) as of January 31, 1999 and January 30, 2000 and the related
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 1997, the one-month period ended January 31, 1998, and each
of the years in the two-year period ended January 30, 2000. In connection with
our audits of the financial statements, we have also audited the accompanying
financial statement schedule. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of NVIDIA Corporation as of
January 31, 1999 and January 30, 2000 and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1997, the one-month period
ended January 31, 1998, and each of the years in the two-year period ended
January 30, 2000, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 (Information as of July 30, 2000 and for the six months ended August 1, 1999
                        and July 30, 2000 is unaudited)

(1) Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

 Organization

  NVIDIA Corporation (the "Company") designs, develops and markets 3D graphics
processors for the PC market. The Company operates primarily in one industry
segment in the United States, Asia and Europe. In April 1998, the Company was
reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.

 Fiscal Year

  Effective January 1, 1998, the Company changed its fiscal year-end financial
reporting period to January 31. The Company elected not to restate its
previous reporting periods ending December 31. In addition, effective February
1, 1998, the Company changed its fiscal year end from January 31 to a 52- or
53-week year ending on the last Sunday in January. As a result, the first and
fourth quarters of fiscal 1999 are 12- and 14-week periods, respectively, with
the remaining quarters being 13-week periods. All four quarters of fiscal 2000
and the first two quarters of fiscal 2001 are 13-week periods.

 Principles of Consolidation

  Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2001, the consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries after elimination of material intercompany accounts and
transactions.

 Interim Financial Information

  The consolidated financial information as of July 30, 2000 and the six
months ended August 1, 1999 and July 30, 2000 is unaudited, but includes all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that the Company
considers necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position at
such dates and the operations and cash flows for the periods then ended.
Operating results for the six months ended July 30, 2000 are not necessarily
indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents

  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents. Currently, the Company's cash equivalents consist of $54.3
million invested in money market funds.

 Inventories

  Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in first-out, cost or market.
Write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving and non-
usable inventory to net realizable value are charged to cost of revenue.

 Property and Equipment

  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives, generally three to
four years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded
under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital
leases are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful life of the asset.

 Software Development Costs

  Software development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological
feasibility of the related product has been established. After technological
feasibility is established, any additional software development

                              NVIDIA CORPORATION

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
         (Information as of July 30, 2000 and for the six months ended
                August 1, 1999 and July 30, 2000 is unaudited)

costs would be capitalized in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 86,
Capitalization of Software Development Costs. Through January 30, 2000, the
Company's process for developing software was completed concurrently with the
establishment of technological feasibility, and, accordingly, no software
costs have been capitalized to date. Software development costs incurred prior
to achieving technological feasibility are charged to research and development
expense as incurred.

 Revenue Recognition

  Revenue from product sales to all customers (excluding distributors) is
recognized upon shipment, net of appropriate allowances. The Company's policy
on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of sales and related gross
profit until the distributors resell the product. Royalty revenue is
recognized upon shipment of product by the licensee to its customers. The
Company believes that the software sold with its products is incidental to the
product as a whole.

 Concentration of Credit Risk

  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade accounts
receivable. The Company invests primarily in money market funds and limits the
amount of exposure to any one financial institution. Four customers accounted
for approximately 37% of the Company's accounts receivable balance at January
30, 2000. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses.

 Research and Development Arrangements

  The Company entered into contractual agreements to provide design,
development and support services on a best efforts basis. All amounts funded
to the Company under these agreements are non-refundable once paid. The
Company recorded reductions to research and development expense after the
services were performed based on the achievement of contractually specified
milestones and the collectability of amounts was assured.

 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

  The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for its stock-based
employee compensation plans. Deferred compensation arising from stock-based
awards is amortized in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 28.

 Income Taxes

  The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recorded or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short
maturity of those instruments.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
         (Information as of July 30, 2000 and for the six months ended
                August 1, 1999 and July 30, 2000 is unaudited)


 Comprehensive Income

  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130,
"Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in financial
statements. The Company had no other components of comprehensive income other
than the reported amounts of net income (loss) in all periods presented.

 Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

 Reclassifications

  Certain prior year amounts in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such
reclassifications had no effect on net income (loss) or stockholders' equity.

 New Accounting Pronouncements

  In March 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," which provides
guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software intended for
internal use. Effective February 1, 1999, the Company adopted SOP 98-1. There
was no material change to the Company's results of operations or financial
position as a result of the adoption of SOP 98-1.

  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or "FASB" issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 133, as amended by
SFAS No. 138, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize
all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and
measure those instruments at fair value. Management does not expect the
adoption of SFAS 133 to have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations or financial position. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 133,
as amended, in fiscal 2002.

  In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements." SAB 101 summarizes certain of the staff's views in
applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue
recognition issues. The Company is required to adopt SAB 101 no later than the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The SEC has recently indicated it intends to
issue further guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed
by SAB 101. Until such time as this additional guidance is issued, the Company
is unable to assess the impact, if any, it may have on its results of
operations or financial position.

 Net Income (Loss) Per Share

  Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and
dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using either
the as-if-converted method for mandatorily convertible notes and convertible
preferred stock or the treasury stock method for options and warrants. Share
and per share data presented reflect the two-for-one stock split effective
June 2000. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and
denominators of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations
for the periods presented:

  As of January 31, 1999 and 1998, options to acquire 1,285,500 and 298,064
shares of common stock with weighted-average exercise prices of $4.43 and
$2.75, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share because the options' exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the Company's common shares and, therefore, the effect would
be antidilutive. Options to purchase 7,470,916 shares of common stock with a
weighted-average exercise price of $0.89, warrants to purchase 317,612 shares
of common stock as well as 18,654,174 shares of convertible preferred stock
were outstanding for the year ended December 31, 1997 but were not included in
the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the Company had a net
loss for that year and to do so would have been antidilutive.

(3) Stockholders' Equity

 Mandatorily Convertible Notes

  Convertible subordinated non-interest bearing notes were issued to three
major customers in July and August 1998 for a total of $11.0 million. The
notes were subordinated to certain senior indebtedness. On January 15, 1999,
the outstanding principal balance of these notes automatically converted into
3,142,858 shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to
$3.50 per share.

 Convertible Preferred Stock

  On January 22, 1999, 18,654,174 shares of preferred stock were automatically
converted into common stock upon the completion of the initial public offering
of common stock. As of January 30, 2000, there are no shares of preferred
stock outstanding and the Company has no current plans to issue any of the
authorized preferred stock.

 1998 Equity Incentive Plan

  The Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), as amended and restated on February
17, 1998, provides for the issuance of up to 30,000,000 shares of the
Company's common stock to directors, employees and consultants. The Plan
provides for the issuance of stock bonuses, restricted stock purchase rights,
incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Each year on the last
day of each fiscal year, starting with the year ending January 31, 1999, the
aggregate number of shares of common stock that are available for issuance
will automatically be increased by a number of shares equal to five percent
(5%) of the Company's outstanding common stock on such date, including on an
as-if-converted basis preferred stock and convertible notes, and outstanding
options and warrants, calculated using the treasury stock method. In January
2000, the shares of common stock available for issuance were increased by
3,861,924 shares pursuant to this provision.

  Pursuant to the Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options is at
least 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant or for employees
owning in excess of 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock, 110% of
the fair market value on the date of grant. For nonstatutory stock options,
the exercise price is no less than 85% of the fair market value on the date of
grant.

  Options generally expire in 10 years. Vesting periods are determined by the
Board of Directors. However, options generally vest ratably over a four year
period, with 25% becoming vested approximately one year from the date of grant
and the remaining 75% vesting on a quarterly basis over the next three years.
Options granted prior to December 1997 could be exercised prior to full
vesting. Any unvested shares so purchased were subject to a repurchase right
in favor of the Company at a repurchase price per share that was equal to the
original per share purchase price. The right to repurchase at the original
price would lapse at the rate of 25% per year over the four-year period from
the date of grant. As of January 30, 2000, there were 999,222 such shares
subject to repurchase.

  The Company accounts for the plan using the intrinsic value method. As such,
compensation expense is recorded if on the date of grant the current fair
value per share of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price per share.
With respect to certain options granted during 1997 and the one month ended
January 31, 1998, the Company recorded deferred compensation of $4,277,000 and
$361,000, respectively, for the difference at the grant date between the
exercise price per share and the fair value per share, based upon independent
valuations and management's estimate of the fair value of the Company's stock
on the various grant dates of the common stock underlying the options. This
amount is being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options,
generally four years.

 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan

  In February 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the 1998 Non-Employee
Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Directors' Plan") to provide for the
automatic grant of options to purchase shares of common stock to directors of
the Company who are not employees of or consultants to the Company or an
affiliate of the Company (a "Non-Employee Director"). The Compensation
Committee administers the Directors' Plan. The aggregate number of shares of
common stock that may be issued pursuant to options granted under the
Directors' Plan is 600,000 shares.

 Stock-Based Compensation

  As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
("SFAS 123"), the Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25") and related Interpretations in accounting for stock-
based awards to employees. Compensation cost for the Company's stock-based
compensation plans as determined consistent with SFAS 123, would have
increased net loss and would have decreased net income to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:

  The fair value of options granted in fiscal 2000 has been estimated at the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions: no dividend yield, risk free interest rate of
5.84%, expected life for the option of five years and volatility of 70%. The
fair value of options granted prior to the initial public offering is
estimated on the date of grant using the minimum value method with the
following weighted-average assumptions: no dividend yield; risk free interest
rate of 5.0% to 6.5%; expected life for the option of five years; and
volatility of 0%. The weighted-average per share fair value of options granted
during the year ended 1997, the one month ended January 31, 1998, the years
ended January 31, 1999 and January 30, 2000 was approximately $.08, $1.43,
$1.74, $1.45 and $13.53, respectively.

  In July 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution allowing employees
to exchange some or all of their existing unvested options to purchase common
stock of the Company for options having an exercise price of $3.15 per share.
The repriced options retain the same vesting schedule as the originally issued
options, but the repriced options did not become exercisable until July 1999.
Options to purchase approximately 2,507,000 shares of common stock were
repriced under this program. Stock options held by executive officers and
directors were not eligible for such repricing.

  During 1997 and fiscal 2000, the Company granted common stock options within
the Plan to consultants for services rendered. The fair value of all option
grants to non-employees has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model using the following assumptions: dividend yield--none; expected
life--contractual term; risk free interest rates--6.0% to 6.5%; volatility--
60%. The estimated fair value of these options was $120,000 and $22,000 in
1997 and fiscal 2000, respectively.

  In 1997, options to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock were granted to
an outside investor during the Series D preferred stock offering. In 1998,
options to purchase 40,000 shares of common stock were granted to an outside
investor. As of January 30, 2000, options to purchase 71,250 shares of common
stock were outstanding, of which 5,000 shares were vested.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

  In February 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"), covering an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares
of common stock. The Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an "employee
stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code. Under the
Purchase Plan, the Board may authorize participation by eligible employees,
including officers, in periodic offerings following the adoption of the
Purchase Plan. Under the Purchase Plan, the offering period for any offering
will be no longer than 27 months. Under the plan offering adopted pursuant to
the Purchase Plan, each offering period has been set at six months. In June
1999, the plan was amended to increase the number of shares reserved for
issuance automatically each year at the end of the Company's fiscal year for
the next 10 years (commencing at the end of fiscal 2000 and ending 10 years
later in 2009) by an amount equal to 2% of the outstanding shares of the
Company on each date, including on an as-if-converted basis preferred stock
and convertible notes, and outstanding options and warrants, calculated using
the treasury stock method, up to a maximum aggregate increase of 12 million
shares over the 10-year period. In January 2000, the shares of common stock
available for issuance were increased by 1,544,770 shares pursuant to this
provision.

  Employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by the Company or
an affiliate of the Company designated by the Board. Employees who participate
in an offering generally can have up to 10% of their earnings withheld
pursuant to the Purchase Plan and applied, on specified dates determined by
the Board, to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase
this percentage at its discretion, up to 15%. The price of common stock
purchased under the Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the
fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each
offering period or the relevant purchase date. Employees may end their
participation in the offering at any time during the offering period, and
participation ends automatically on termination of employment with the
Company. At January 30, 2000, 257,654 shares have been issued under the
Purchase Plan and 2,287,116 shares have been reserved for further issuance.

  The fair value of options granted under the Purchase Plan in fiscal 2000 has
been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions: no dividend yield, risk
free interest rate of 5.21% , expected life for the option of 0.5 years and
volatility of 70%. The weighted-average fair value of shares granted under the
Purchase Plan during the year ended January 30, 2000 was approximately $3.92
per share.

(4) Financial Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies

 Short-term Borrowings

  In July 1999, the Company entered into an amended loan and security
agreement with a bank, which included a $10.0 million revolving loan agreement
with a borrowing base equal to 80% of eligible accounts. Borrowings under the
line of credit bear interest at the prime rate, which was 8.5% at January 30,
2000, and are due in July 2000. Covenants governing the loan agreement require
the maintenance of certain financial ratios. As of January 30, 2000, the
Company had no outstanding borrowings against the line of credit. The
agreement expired on July 29, 2000.

 Lease Obligations

  The Company leases certain office facilities under operating leases expiring
through 2003. Future minimum lease payments under the Company's noncancelable
capital and operating leases as of January 30, 2000, are as follows (in
thousands):

 Litigation

  On April 9, 1998, the Company was notified that SGI had filed a patent
infringement lawsuit against it in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware. The suit alleged that the sale and use of the Company's
RIVA family of 3D graphics processors infringed a United States patent held by
SGI. The suit sought

unspecified damages (including treble damages), an order permanently enjoining
further alleged infringement and attorneys' fees. In July 1999, the matter
settled during trial and it has been dismissed. As part of the settlement, the
Company entered into agreements with SGI to create a broad strategic alliance
to collaborate on future graphics technologies. As part of the agreements, SGI
dismissed its patent infringement suit against the Company and the Company
licensed SGI's 3D graphics patent portfolio. Additionally, SGI agreed to
incorporate the Company's graphics technology into new desktop graphics
systems and transfer engineering personnel to the Company during the third
quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company agreed to pay SGI a total of $3.0 million
in nine quarterly installments with the final payment due in May 2001. The
rights to patents recorded under other assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over five years.

  On May 11, 1998, S3 filed a patent infringement suit against the Company in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The
suit alleged that the Company's sale of RIVA 128, 128ZX and TNT graphics
processors infringed three United States patents owned by S3. The suit sought
unspecified damages (including treble damages), an order permanently enjoining
further alleged infringement and attorneys' fees. The Company and S3 agreed to
settle this case on February 1, 2000, on the basis of mutual patent cross-
licenses and on February 7, 2000, the District Court entered a final judgment
in the Company's favor, dismissing all of S3's claims.

  On September 21, 1998, 3Dfx filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the
Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California alleging infringement of a 3Dfx patent. On March 2, 1999, 3Dfx
added a second patent to the suit and on May 24, 1999, 3Dfx added a third
patent to the suit. The amended complaint alleges that the Company's RIVA TNT,
RIVA TNT2 and RIVA TNT2 Ultra products infringe the patents in suit and seeks
unspecified compensatory and trebled damages and attorneys' fees. The
Company's current generation of products is not identified as infringing any
of the patents in suit. The Company has filed an answer and counter-claims
asserting that the patents in suit are invalid and not infringed. These
assertions are supported by the Company's investigations to date and an
opinion from the Company's patent counsel in this suit. The Company
anticipates that the trial date will be set by the District Court after it
rules on claims construction issues.

  In addition to the above litigation, from time to time the Company is
subject to claims in the ordinary course of business, none of which in the
Company's view, would have a material adverse impact on the Company's business
or financial position if resolved unfavorably.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
         (Information as of July 30, 2000 and for the six months ended
                August 1, 1999 and July 30, 2000 is unaudited)


  The valuation allowance had decreases of $1,298,000 and $4,784,000 for the
year ended January 31, 1999 and the year ended January 30, 2000, respectively.
Management believes that it is more likely than not that future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.

(6) Development Agreement

  The Company had a strategic collaboration agreement with ST for the
manufacture, marketing, and sale of certain of the Company's products. In
1996, ST paid the Company $2,500,000 for advanced royalty payments and agreed
to partially support the research and development and marketing efforts for
certain of the Company's products. In connection with this agreement, the
Company recorded royalty revenue of $1,791,000, $1,911,000 and $6,824,000, in
1997, the one month ended January 31, 1998, and the year ended January 31,
1999, respectively. Royalty revenue decreased to zero in fiscal 2000 due
primarily to reduced sales of RIVA 128 graphics processor and derivative
products and disputes with ST regarding payment. The Company does not expect
to record or receive royalty revenue from ST in the future. The Company also
recorded a reduction to research and development cost of $1,936,000 and a
reduction to sales, general and administrative expense of $314,000 in 1997. In
January of 1998, ST agreed to forgive the $2,500,000 in advanced royalty
payments in exchange for the Company's obligation to provide ST continued
development and support on certain products developed through December 31,
1998, which was recorded as a reduction to research and development expense in
fiscal 1999. Accordingly, $2,500,000 is included in accrued liabilities at
December 31, 1997. The costs incurred under the development agreement
approximated the amounts recorded as reduction to expenses.

(7) Long-term Software Licensing Agreement

  On April 12, 1999, the Company entered into a $10.0 million five-year
software licensing agreement with a supplier in the electronic design
automation industry. Under this agreement, the $10.0 million is due in two
installments. The first installment was settled in June 1999 for 487,804
shares of the Company's common stock valued at $5.0 million. The second
installment was settled in cash on March 31, 2000.

(8) Stock Repurchase Agreement

  In June 1999, the Company repurchased 857,144 shares of the Company's common
stock from a major customer in settlement for a portion of then outstanding
accounts receivable, in the amount of $7.5 million.

(9) Segment Information

  The Company operates in a single industry segment: the design, development
and marketing of 3D graphics processors for the PC market. The Company's chief
operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial
information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating
decisions and assessing financial performance. The following table summarizes
geographic information on net sales:

(11) Microsoft Agreement

  On March 5, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Microsoft
pursuant to which the Company agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to
license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox
video game console under development by Microsoft. In April 2000, Microsoft
paid the Company $200 million as an advance against graphics chip purchases.
Microsoft may terminate the agreement at any time. If termination occurs prior
to offset in full of the advance payments, the Company would be required to
return to Microsoft up to $100 million of the prepayment and to convert the
remainder into preferred stock of the Company at a 30% premium to the 30-day
average trading price of the common stock immediately preceding Microsoft's
termination of the agreement. In addition, in the event that an individual or
corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal or greater than thirty
percent (30%) of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock,
Microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The
graphics chip contemplated by the agreement is highly complex, and the
development and release of the Microsoft Xbox game console and its commercial
success are dependent upon a number of factors, many of which the Company
cannot control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be successful in
developing the graphics chip for use by Microsoft or that the product will be
developed or released, or if released, will be commercially successful.

(12) Stockholders' Equity and Stock Split

  In May 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split of the Company's common stock for stockholders of record on June 12,
2000, to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The transfer agent
distributed the shares resulting from the split on June 26, 2000. All share
and per-share numbers contained herein have been restated to reflect this
stock split.

(13) Subsequent Event (Unaudited)

  In August 2000, the Company signed an agreement with ELSA AG to market a
complete line of professional workstation products, designed and built by the
Company. The Company will market directly to major original equipment
manufacturers or OEMs, while ELSA will retain the worldwide exclusive
distribution rights to market to all other channels, including system
integrators, value-added resellers and distributors. The Company paid ELSA
$3.0 million at signing of the agreement and the second installment of $3.0
million is due in September 2000 for all workstation software source code and
related intellectual property. As part of the agreement, twelve engineers from
the ELSA's workstation graphics team joined the Company.

  On August 28, 2000, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against
3Dfx in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. The lawsuit alleges that 3Dfx's graphics chip and card products,
which are used to accelerate 3D graphics on personal computers, infringe five
of the Company's patents and seeks an injunction restraining 3Dfx from
manufacturing, selling or importing infringing graphics chip and card products
including its Voodoo3, Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 and VSA-100 family of products, as
well as monetary damages. The matter is in its earliest stages, discovery has
not yet begun and no trial date has been set.

  On February 22, 2000, Graphiques Matrox, Inc. and Systemes Electroniques
Matrox Ltd. (collectively "Matrox") filed suit against the Company in the
Superior Court, Judicial District of Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada. The
suit alleges that the Company improperly solicited and recruited Matrox
employees and encouraged Matrox employees to breach their Matrox
confidentiality and/or non-competition agreements. The suit by Matrox seeks,
among other things, certain injunctive relief. The Company believes that the
claims asserted by Matrox are without merit and the Company intends to
vigorously defend this suit.

  On May 19, 2000, the Company filed suit against Matrox in Santa Clara County
Superior Court alleging that Matrox's efforts to prevent its current and
former employees from pursuing employment opportunities with the Company
constitute interference with prospective economic advantage and contract and
unfair competition. The Company's suit seeks, among other things, unspecified
monetary damages, a declaration that Matrox's confidentiality and/or non-
competition agreements are unenforceable under California law and a
declaration that its use of those agreements and other tactics constitutes
unfair competition. On May 26, 2000, the case was transferred to the San Jose
Division of the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. On June 14, 2000, Matrox filed an answer denying the Company's
claims and a counterclaim alleging trade secret misappropriation, intentional
interference with contractual relations and unfair competition. Matrox's
California suit seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. The
Company filed an answer to this counterclaim on July 7, 2000, denying all of
Matrox's claims. As with the Montreal action, the Company believes that the
claims asserted by Matrox are without merit and intends to vigorously defend
this suit.

  On August 1, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 2000
Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan (the "2000 Plan") to provide for the
issuance of up to 2,317,155 shares of the Company's common stock to employees
and affiliates who are not directors, officers or 10% stockholders. The 2000
Plan provides for the issuance of nonstatutory stock options, stock bonuses
and restricted stock purchase rights. Options generally expire in 10 years.
The Compensation Committee appointed by the Board of Directors has the
authority to determine the option term, exercise price and vesting period of
each grant. However, options generally vest ratably over a four-year period,
with 25% becoming vested approximately one year from the date of grant and the
remaining 75% vesting on a quarterly basis over the next three years.
